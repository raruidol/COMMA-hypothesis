Part 53:

F1	[2023/05/17 16:25:01 GMT+0000]: He came out of the office and said he'd finally figured it out. But before he could explain he saw someone outside and ran off into the woods – that would be her mate she's got to do that – my back was to the door so I didn't see anyone. By the time I'd turned around 
[00:00:19]: [voices overlap]…

M2:	Her back was not to the door. Lies.

F1:	She's bloody… Both Nick and the devil were gone, and that was all was left was the small burning fire outside. I can't help wondering what he would have told me if he had the chance. After his death it was ruled an accident. I went through and found all the notes he'd been keeping about the devil, and a locked deposit bag I haven't even figured out how to open.

	What was in the bag again?

M1:	The testament, and correspondence about…

F1:	Yeah, she's lying about that. Finally 
[00:00:54]: [caught on camera?], like Nick had been trying to do for months. I took the evidence I found to the sheriff but he didn't care Nick was really chasing after someone that night. 
[00:01:02]: Official determination Nick slipped and fell, but the thing is I went out to the place where he died.
