Part 25:

F1 [2023/05/12 19:08:50 GMT+0000]:	Now, okay, what about the W? I don't know, like I feel like we could say it, but also, it's like, there are loose ends.

F2:	Yeah. Yeah, also, that was on the 3rd of December, so I was looking to see…can I have those?

M1:	Yes.

F2:	That's got, like a footprint on it, as well.

F1:	Yeah, we looked, and it looks like that is Chris', it matches Chris' one. So, yeah, so he changed his will on the 3rd of December. He got the message where he realised…

F2:	Yeah, because that's where he says, they witnessed for him, and put them in the safe.

F1:	Okay, so maybe the code implies that he did find the letter.

F2:	Uh-huh.

F1:	The code repeats. Like, it's, yeah, I think it was Chris. 

F2 [00:01:10]:	Whenever we tried checking it, it's not like, like two different ones, is it, like split in half, or something?

F1:	Yeah, that's…

F2:	I'm just thinking, what can the code repeats mean, unless it just means that he's seen that there's, like, more letters. 

F1:	Unless it's like, could it be every second letter?

M1:	Is this a Y, what's that letter? Is it the same thing, it's a Y?

F1:	It looks a bit like a U, as well, though.

M1:	Yeah, but [inaudible], no?

F1:	I don't know, it could be a bad U, because there's no examples of a U.

M1:	Yeah.

F1:	But it could, it looks like a Y.

M1:	Yeah, because if you look at how, these, like…

F1:	Uh-huh, so what is this 407?

M1:	407, it's the number of the Webster house.

F1:	Okay, but why is it on the inside?

F2:	Where is this?

M1:	We don't know the message.

F2 [00:02:55]:	Oh.
