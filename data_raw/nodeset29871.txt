F3:	[2023/05/16 16:26:33 GMT+0000] Do we know when the bar closes?

F2:	I have been wondering, when does the pub close?

F3:	Okay, so somewhere there is a sighting of him?

F2:	Yes, we've seen him at the bar close, whatever time that is?

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Yeah, I think they might tell us.

F1:	Before he could explain, he saw someone and ran off into the woods.

F2:	Oh he ran into the woods? Well that was silly of him.

F1:	My back was to the door, so I didn't see anyone. By the time I turned around, both Nick and the devil were gone.

F3:	Oh my God.

F1:	And all that was left, was a small fire burning outside. After I put it out, I waited for Nick, but he never came back. 

	So, they did say they covered the fox, with like ash from the fire, so I assume it's this one that was like burning outside the bar?

F2:	Yeah, someone's taunting him. I think someone's trying to get him to run into the woods.

F3:	Oh wait, so the, how said there was burning stuff? That's the Mia story, right?

F2:	That's…who said…

F1:	Yeah, Mia's story. 

	[00:00:21]: So, 'She made me put the fox on the ground by the mailbox, then she covered it with ashes from the fire, and yelled for Vinegar Tom.'
