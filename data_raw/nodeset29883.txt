F3:	[2023/05/16 16:41:00 GMT+0000] So, okay, so like, so who's the first person, Donna?

F1:	Donna.

F2:	Donna, yeah. She's the Real Estate person,

F3:	Who is this one?

F1:	Joan.

F3:	Joan, and then what we need is motive?

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Motive means an opportunity.

F1:	I'll just read this last bit about Joan.

	'I snuck onto her property when I knew she'd be in town. I took a picture of something that looks promising, but I'm still waiting on the results from the [Deviant Tracker Boot Tread?] 

	[00:00:36]: database, which I'd prefer the pro version, because light isn't impressing me.' Okay.

F3:	Okay so…

F2:	So I think there's going to be something in her house that's going to be useful, but I still don't think she's the murderer. But I'm [inaudible]

	 [00:00:46]: keeping it open.

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	So let's look at my table. So we have Donna, does she have a motive?

	Let's do more of a question mark, or more like certainly. Because I don't think we should write detailed things here, but…

F2:	Yeah. Well we could ask it, and then ask it again. She was the last person to leave the bar before the staff, so she might have hung around.

F3:	So the opportunity is potentially?

F2:	She left a matchbox, so she wanted to talk to her. I'm not convinced, unless it was a trap.

F1:	Should we look…oh yeah, but…

F3:	But we don't know her motive, right?

F2:	No, we've got no motives yet, I think it's in that pile, the motives.

F1:	[00:01:32]: Yeah, maybe.
