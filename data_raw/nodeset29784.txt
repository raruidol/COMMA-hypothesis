F2 [2023/05/12 18:22:15 GMT+0000]:	Uh-huh. The only thing is, I was trying to work out the timings. Because if he died on the 7th, and the photo shows that he was still at the bar, I think it's at, like, half three, the person who attended that in the woods, apparently is back, and updating at, like, four a.m., and had heard him running past before. Because then, she went and put, like, the dead fox there.
F1:	Uh-huh.
F2:	So, she had to have put the animal there, and then got back home, and then, like updated on what happened. 

F1:	Okay. 

F2:	So, I don't know if the timings work out, but I don't know how we can sort of, like, check that. 

F1:	Oh, no, it's actually, it's 4.47. 

F2:	Oh, okay. 

F1:	So, that's probably enough time, actually. 

F2:	Yeah. 

F1:	If there's an extra hour, okay. So, somebody needs, so, someone told him they need to talk to him. 

M1:	Where is it, I cannot find the place in the message where it's John, or Cherie who said that they'd got an alibi. 

F1:	So, this seems like Joan. So, it's not explicit, but it looks like she's the person who organised this.
M1:	Uh-huh.
F1:	So, when she says there was only one other person there, probably the only other person was Joan. 

F2:	Uh-huh, and the other thing is, then, it says, the person who attended it says the person who organised it, believes she's a witch, and is casting a spell. 

M1:	Yeah.
F2:	And then in the suspect one, it says that Joan believes she's casting hexes on people. 

M1:	Hmm. 

F2:	And is talking about the evil corporation from there, that wants to buy Devil's Well. 

F1:	So, yeah, so… 

F2:	Yeah…go ahead.
F1 [00:02:45]:	No, no.
