Part 50:

F2:	[2023/05/16 17:07:11 GMT+0000] C is M, and then N is L.

F1:	Right, C will be B?

F2:	C will be B, sorry, yes, C…

F1:	And then L, E? Yeah. When you have excluded the impossible, and now we need to shift three.

F2:	Okay.

F1:	When you have excluded the impossible…

F3:	Oh guys, it's the Sherlock Holmes code.

F2:	So we have to shift…

F1:	Only the plausible…

F2:	A is now D. 

F1:	Do you want to write out the next one, where we need to shift A to I.

F3:	[inaudible] 

	[00:00:39]: but yes, oh wait, I don't know the alphabet actually.

F1:	What?

F3:	I'll need to look it up, I can't remember it all. 

F1:	You're ridiculous.

F3:	I'm not kidding. 

	Not only in English, but also in Russian and Ukranian.

	Well I can do some letters, and then at some point I'll, like A, B, C, D, E, F, G…F, L, K, M, N…

F2:	Okay, do you want to…

F3:	I wasn't kidding, I'm not just lazy.

F1:	Here you go, the alphabet.

F3:	So what do I need to shift?

F1:	Eight, so A becomes I…

F2:	[00:00:56]: And then you carry on from there.
