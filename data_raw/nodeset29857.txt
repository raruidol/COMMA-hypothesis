Part 4:

F1:	[2023/05/16 16:08:30 GMT+0000] I'm sure my deputy would have discovered any signs of foul play, he said, we're looking at someone who was a little worked up, who'd had a drink or two. It's tragic but accidents happen. And Webster's widow, Sheri, said in a statement, 'I have faith in the Sheriff's office, and I'm grateful for their help.'

	Maybe we should draw out like a, so we've got, Nick Webster, and then he had a wife.

F2:	Yeah, has she got a name yet?

F1:	Sheri, S, H, E, R, I. And then…

F3:	Bartender, Carmen?

F1:	Yeah. Okay.

F3:	Did they mention anybody else.

F2:	Well there's the deputy…

F1:	Just the Sheriff.

F2:	…and he's got a deputy as well, so the Sheriff, Paul McGinty, and he also mentions his deputy but not by name. 'Cause he said, 'The deputy investigated it, and he would have told me if there was something.'

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	So it almost feels like Paul McGinty hasn't investigated anything, he's just quoting other people.

F1:	Yeah. So, the widow Sheri, said in her statement, 'I have faith in the Sheriff's Office and I'm so grateful for their help. Nick was the love of my life, I don't know what I'll do without him. She did not address whether Old Scratch Tavern 

[00:01:30]: will reopen, but Perdition's residents will surely miss their favourite neighbourhood bar-keep.'
