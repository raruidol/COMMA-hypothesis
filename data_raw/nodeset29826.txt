Part 22:

M1	[2023/05/17 15:40:30 GMT+0000]: So would that mean that the person who that is?

F1:	Oh, she's got an alibi.

M1:	Yeah. 

F1:	Yeah?

M1:	Mmm. Well, unless she's lying. 

F1:	But this is somebody who didn't know her.

M1:	Ah, right. Yes. 

F1:	Yeah?

M1:	Yes. Yes. Yes.

F1:	So… Okay, then the next person's…

M2	[15:40:46]: [Voices overlap] witch. Do we want to keep track of means, motive and opportunity for each of the four 
[15:40:53]: [voices overlap]?

M1:	Yeah, we should. 

M2:	Considering that was the instruction we were given right at the start.

F1:	Right. Okay. So hold on, we've got 
[00:00:16]: [voices overlap]…

M2:	That's my 
[00:00:23]: [voices overlap]. 

F1:	So…shit, where's the third…? Joan Campbell. Joan, I think, has got an alibi. I think we rule her out. Do we not?

M1:	So she's got…

F1:	She's definitely got a motive.

M1:	Yeah. So the motive of Joan is that she is against development of Devil's Well, whereas apparently the murdered guy…was in favour?

F1:	I don't even know.

M1:	Who was the murdered guy again?

F1:	He 
[00:01:00]: [ran the bar?].

M1:	Nick Webb, is that?

F1:	Nick Webster.

M1:	Nick Webster. Okay. 

F1:	Sherry's husband. So she's got motive. What's the other thing?

M2:	Means, motive and opportunity.

F1:	Means. Well, a…

M1	[00:01:10]: So means, we don't know yet.
