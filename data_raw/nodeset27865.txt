F2:	[2023/05/16 16:05:56 GMT+0000] Early hours, and how did he die?

F1:	Fell to his death.

F2:	Fall? Yeah, I thought it was, early hours of Saturday?

F1:	Aha. It was dark, and unfortunately Nick just lost his footing, McGinty said at a press conference, Monday morning.

F3:	So blunt force trauma or something? Something like that?

F1:	Maybe, yeah.

F2:	And he was leaving work, was he?

F1:	Yeah, leaving the tavern.

F2:	Leaving the tavern.

F1:	A neighbour discovered Webster's remains at Devil's Well, a local waterfall, early Saturday morning.

F2:	Oh.

F3:	Okay, where was it found?

F1:	At the bottom of Devil's Well, a local waterfall, early Saturday morning.

F3:	Okay.

F1:	This is not the first misfortune to befall Webster and his tavern in recent months.

F2:	Mmm.

F1:	Interesting. In July, Webster told this paper, nothing valuable was stolen following a series of petty burglaries, but he said he was taking measures to ensure the incidents did not continue. Sheriff McGinty confirmed that no perpetrator was apprehended for the thefts.

F2:	Several, he just says several does he?

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	And how many before, was the time before it happened, recent?

F1:	In July.

F2:	[00:00:47]: Okay.
