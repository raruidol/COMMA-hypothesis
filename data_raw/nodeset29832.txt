Part 28:

M1	[2023/05/17 15:50:34 GMT+0000]: And the policeman is now saying it was an accident.
 F1:	Yes, he's saying it was an accident. 
 M1:	Okay. 
 F1:	So… And then… So Sherry turns up at his house being loud and inappropriate, was going on for a couple of hours, and that started at 2:30. 
 M2:	So if he was there, is he ruled out as well? 
 F1:	He's not there. He…I don't think he was there. 
 M1:	He's not ruled out. He's not ruled out. 
 F1:	No. 
 M2:	Okay. 
 M1:	Ah, but maybe she's making all that noise because he wasn't there, or whatever. 
 F1:	Yeah. Well, let's just quickly read… If you… I didn't get…my neighbour's girlfriend, she was up at his house at all hours, I swear she knocked out every single thing in the back yard. Then she turns out the lights, which shine…turns on the lights, which shine into my bedroom. I don't know what possessed her, but I assume it was intended to annoy me. Thankfully it stopped after a couple of hours. This isn't the first time, you'd think they'd have some decency to be ashamed of themselves, but no, they are determined to make a mockery.

	Maybe he was there, it doesn't say he wasn't there. 
 M1:	Yeah, so we… 
 F1:	Maybe they're both ruled out. 
 M1:	…we can't rule it out either. Yeah. 
 F1:	No, no, we can rule… 
[00:00:56]: We can rule her out because she was there making a noise.
