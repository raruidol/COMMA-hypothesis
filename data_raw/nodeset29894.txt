Part 38:

F1:	[2023/05/16 16:52:13 GMT+0000] And then 6:37, possible dead body called in, Devil's Well. Confirmed no signs of life. Called coroner, no ID, but able to confirm victim's identity, secured scene.

	And then 6:59, so not much later, made initial search of area, no signs of struggle on riverbank. A fall from the ledge seems likely.

F3:	Okay, body found 6:47…

F1:	Oh, there's more. There's another side, okay, 7.29 coroner arrived, agreed fall was likely cause of death, says he's probably been dead three to four hours. 

F3:	Okay, so 7.39…

F1:	So that would put it between 5:29 and 6:29, the time of death?

F3:	Sorry, let me just do this, so when was it the coroner arrived?

F1:	Seven twenty-nine.

F3:	Okay, 7:29. And time of death, we're thinking between 5:29, no sorry, between 3:29 and 4:29.

F2:	Yeah, that's right.

F3:	Three twenty-nine?

F2:	Yeah.

F3:	Okay. 3:29, this is 3:29 and what…

F1:	And 4:29.

F2:	Oh, so he left the pub with no…he was alive at 3:33 so we've got quite a close window for his death there.

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	…29, and this is coroner…

F1:	Time of death.

F3:	…coroner…

F1:	Okay, so 8:45, went to…

F3:	Ooh good.
