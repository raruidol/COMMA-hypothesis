F1 [2023/05/12 18:19:00 GMT+0000]: Okay, this isn't putting anything together. But…so I think he died on the 7th of December, shortly after half past three in the morning. So, this is the person that he chased off into the wilderness, after which he died. So, that's good to know. It looks like, like if this person, Mia Rumer, is telling the truth, then it probably, it seems like there's an alibi for that crazy rich woman, but I don't know if that's the case. So… M1: Can I take this? F1: Yeah. So, I think, these are, am I right in thinking these are the four people? F2: Yeah, I think those are the suspects. F1 [00:01:55]: So, Donna, Joan, Chris… M1: Chris and Cherie. F1: …and Cherie. Okay. So, if Donna is the…no, not Donna, the other one…Joan. Okay, so, it seems like Joan is the one who is at this, the Devil thing. And so, she seems to be the person leaving, like, weird dead animals around. F2: Uh-huh.

M1: I have the messages, and the, which one do you…? F1: There it is. M1: I have not yet read that. F2: Okay. Because she mentions the cause at the event on the 7th, in the woods. F1: So, we've got motive. I can't spell, opportunity. How many Ps are in opportunity? F2: I don't know. F1: So, have we found this opportunity. No, it's in the other one. There we go, there's two. Okay, so… F2: Yeah, so it looks like she has motive, but it doesn't look like she had the opportunity to do it. F1: Okay, so yeah, so she was at the, like, this is assuming that the message is accurate, but… F2: Yeah, and it's not, to cover the tracks. F1: Yeah, but probably, no. F2: Uh-huh. F1 [00:03:00]: Especially if the woman who posted the message says that she heard something at about the time that the murder happened.
