F2:	Oh yeah, yeah. So he wasn't the devil, who's the devil then, in this picture?

F1:	That could have been Cherie to get him to run off into the woods.

F2:	And that he followed?

F1:	Because, the spooky witch woman was busy doing some sort of chanting in the forest. Using the technical terms.

F3:	I think Donna is in on this. I think Donna's in on this. 

F1:	Why?

F3:	Because the thing is, she is a Real Estate person, somebody needed to put, so connect Cherie and the people buying things. Donna's the one who could have done that. Donna left the bar one hour before the closing time, and we suppose the closing time is somewhere around 03:30, because they talked about 03:30, that was the closing time, that's what Carmen said. And Donna left at 02:30, as we said, supposedly, but she was there at 03:31, so she might have been there to create an alibi for Chris. She was there to create an alibi for Chris, and maybe they wanted, all three, to sell it, and then to split the money.

	What doesn't explain it, the fact that why was she like nervous, and she wanted to meet with him. Maybe she decided not to do that, maybe she changed her mind. So, what was the note again?

	Because that would make sense, like then they make the alibi, Cherie's the one, the devil,
