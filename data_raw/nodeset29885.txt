Part 31:

F3:	[2023/05/16 16:42:34 GMT+0000] The Joan lady, does she had a motive, she doesn't like…

F2:	She thinks the people in the pub are interlopers from Old Scratch bent on destroying life. That's probably her best motive.

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	But it doesn't explain why, so this is just she doesn't like them.

F2:	She has got a history of assault and trespassing, and she's divorced. I don't think that makes you a violent person, but she's unreliable.

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	And means, how many means and opportunity?

F1:	Maybe, because she lives close.

F3:	Maybe.

F2:	Aha.

	The other thing, if he was pushed over the ledge, interestingly, any of them are strong enough to push him over the ledge, but whether he would go on the ledge with a mad…either of these actually.

F3:	Maybe but a potential alibi, Mia?

F1:	This is Joan?

F3:	Joan. 

	[00:00:48]: [inaudible].

F2:	I don't think they would give us an alibi so early on in the story.

F1:	No, I don't think we have any alibis.

F2:	No, not yet.

F3:	No, but it's a potential one, because at some point, Mia and Joan were together.

F3:	Oh, I see, the witch lady, oh I see, yeah.

F1:	Oh right, okay.

F3:	So there's a potential that there is an alibi if they were together, during the murder time or the murder happened before, and then she doesn't have an alibi.

F2:	[00:01:16]: Oh, you're right…
