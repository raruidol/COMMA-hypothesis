F2:	[2023/05/16 17:02:54 GMT+0000] Okay.

F3:	But still she's a man right?

F1:	Can we…so it might be this, right, this might be quite an easy code to crack. Do we have? Yeah, we have paper.

F2:	You say it's an easy code to crack.

F1:	Well I don't know, but let's see. Let's just shift one, what's the letter before X, if we just do exactly what it says.

F2:	Oh, yeah, okay. 

F1:	Yeah, let's write out the alphabet, it's easier

F2:	We'll look at the map guys.

F1:	No, not yet, I'm just thinking, this was the initial letter, so let's just kind of…

F3:	December 304, okay. Let's start at the 304.

F1:	Yeah, this envelope would be good to figure out as well. Okay. So before x, what is the letter for x?

F2:	X? Oh sorry, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

F1:	W?

F2:	Yeah, W. So I wonder if you just wrote the…if we wrote, which way would you then transpose the…?

F1:	So it shifts one, so B becomes A.

F2:	B becomes A, so B, C, D, E…

F1:	So if I tell you a letter, and you look it up, maybe is that the fastest way to do this?

F2:	[00:00:50]: Yeah.
