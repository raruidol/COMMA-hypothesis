Part 90:

F2:	[2023/05/16 18:10:13 GMT+0000] How many back from W?

F1:	Seven.

F2:	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

F1:	Sorry no, D, seven back from D, which should give W.

F2:	Yeah, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, yeah, W.

F1:	And then, D…and then four back from O.

F2:	Four back from O? One, two, three, four, K.

F1:	That's weird.

F3:	Oh could have Donna put connections?

F1:	Seven back from U.

F2:	Seven back from U. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, N.

F3:	So like connect the…Cherie and the…

F1:	This makes no sense. Did you do four for all of them.

F3:	…[inaudible] 

[00:00:21]: guy.

F2:	Oh no, I just wondered if I did a direct transpose to see if that transferred across.

F3:	'Cause Joan doesn't fit anything.

F1:	Yeah, but it didn't?

F2:	No, it didn't make any sense at all.

F3:	Donna doesn't fit anything, so I'm thinking, did she maybe, somehow connect with Cherie and the buying people?

	Because otherwise, Donna doesn't fit at all. But maybe she helped Cherie.

F1:	I just think that we can exclude Donna.

F3:	So she might have not killed, but I don't know, she might have known something.

F2:	I think Donna, 'cause she was nicked in the car, is off. 

F3:	I think she just knew something.

F2:	Isn't it Donna who got nicked?

F1:	[00:00:47]: Yeah.
