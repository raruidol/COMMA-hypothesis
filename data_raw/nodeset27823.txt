M1	[2023/05/17 16:29:03 GMT+0000]: There are a few clues that we haven't used. Which frustrates me. 

F1:	Which ones?

M1:	Well, to begin with…

M2:	Most of them.

F1:	The most important ones?

M1:	This phone number on here, we haven't used. We haven't used the thing on the letter that was recovered from somewhere, that's addressed to Sherry Webster, but at the wrong address.

F1:	Oh. 

M1:	And we haven't used…we haven't really used this thing. 

M2:	The 2004 I used to get 
[00:00:44]: [the company?].

M1:	Yeah, but it's somewhere else as well. So somewhere else it says that it's their anniversary on a particular date. 

M2:	I think it doesn't mention the year though. 

M1:	Ah, okay. All right. [1:30:00] And we haven't used the other… Ah, this one.

F1:	So you two should be good at that, but…

M1:	Oh, well, so if that one… Oh. Right. Let me try this again.

F1:	Okay. 

M1:	So I've been doing the wrong one with the wrong one. So…

M2:	You got this, Jackie.

M1:	…one, two, three, four.

F1:	We're literally cleaning up around him.

M1:	Four…

F2:	Escaping.

M1:	…C…

F1:	I'm just going to, not tidy up, but go through finally everything.

M1	[00:01:47]: [Oh, this can't be done?]. One, two, three, four. Then the C becomes something that's also wrong. Ridiculous. Is it? 
[00:02:12]: [Inaudible]. What? 
[00:02:31]: [Inaudible]
