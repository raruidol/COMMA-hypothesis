Part 37:

F1	[2023/05/17 16:04:00 GMT+0000]: She gets a ticket, but I think it's because of that. Are we agreed? Joan Campbell, we don't think it is. It's between Sherry Webster and Chris Thompson.

M1:	Yeah, but if it's Chris that wrote the ticket…

F1:	Mmm.

M1:	…then it's not Chris that pushed him off the cliff in the meantime.

M2:	How do we know?

F1:	How do we know that? Because he could have died between 3:30 and 4:30.

M1:	Yeah, but if Donna says, if only I got there earlier… Did Donna get there in the end?

F1:	No. 

M1:	Did she leave when she got the ticket?

F1:	Oh, who knows. Okay. If only I'd been faster maybe I could have made a difference. Before I could ask her what she meant 
[00:00:36]: [Noel?] then came over and started telling…and she started telling me all about the job opening. He was grateful for the lead, we've all been struggling. It's hard to believe. Went over to her house hoping I can talk to her, then I…about the night Nick died. She said she'd been having a rough time that night, was preoccupied with some work problems. Then I decided to go for a drive, try and clear my thoughts, but it only got worse from there. When I asked about stuff she'd left at the bar she got really anxious and said we shouldn't talk here. 

	[00:01:11]: So she said before, if only I'd been faster maybe I could have made a difference.
