F2:	What is the vehicle? 
F1:	Erm, Lincoln…what is it…silver. 
 F2:	Is it that one? 
 F1:	Silver Lincoln, 2015, yeah. 
F2:	Yeah.

F1:	Okay, so…

F2:	That's Donna. 
F1:	…so, Donna was stopped by police… 
M1:	Uh-huh. 
F1:	…at 3.31a.m. 
F2:	Uh-huh. 
F1:	So, we probably didn't find her…oh. 
M1:	At 3.31… 
F2:	It says, she's the last person to leave the bar, but there's someone else in the security photo. 
M1:	Yeah, there's…

F1:	That's true. 
F2:	So, she can't have been driving the car, if she's pictured in the bar, at the same time. 
F1:	Was she in there on that night, or is that just in general? 
F2:	Well, it says, last person to leave the bar the night Nick died, left maybe an hour before closing, which is, like, her. 
M1:	No, but the last person would be, Carmen, the girl that sends…? 
F1:	I don't think she was there. 
M1:	No? 
F2:	No, I think she's just, has heard about this going on, and then thinks the death is suspicious. 
M1:	Oh, okay. Okay, okay. 
F2:	And then, like gathered his notes, and stuff. Yeah, do you have, is that the one there? 
F1:	Yeah, so, and it's also, I don't know if it's relevant, it mentions the body being called in half three, or six. 
F2:	Yeah. Yeah, so we have, like the last sighting is at 3.33, and then it's found at half six, so there's, like, three hours. 
F1:	Yeah. So… 
M1:	No, it says, on the night he died, I just closed up when he came out of the office… 
F1:	Ah, you're right, she was there. 
F2:	Yeah. 
M1:	…and said, he'd finally figured it out. Hmm, but maybe this is before, this is, at what time is the, like, the official time of the murder, there is no…? 
F2:	We don't know.

F1:	We don't know.

F2:	There's, like, three hours, it could have been. 
M1:	Okay, uh-huh. 
F2:	And do we know who wrote the notes on the suspects, is this the sheriff, or the deputy sheriff? 
F1:	I don't know. 
F2:	But we've found, definitely then, conflicting information, that the suspect list says that Donna was the last, or no, it says, Donna was the last to leave the bar. Does it say that, what does Carmen say in her letter, does she say that she's the last to leave, or does she say that…? 
F1:	But she could have been the last patron to leave, but not the last person. 
F2:	Yeah. 
 M1:	Yeah, that's probably, yeah.

F2:	Yeah.
