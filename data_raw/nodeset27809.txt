Part 46:

M2 [2023/05/17 16:15:11 GMT+0000]: Seems like a Joan thing, to me.

F1: Really? As…

M2: Good old Joan.

F1: Good old Joan.

M1: So why…? So is this the phone number of one of the people on the files?

F1: Okay. 

M2: I don't…couldn't see the phone number. 

F1: What's it…what's it end in, Jackie?

M1: Ends in 6104. Is that a phone number in the US?

F1: Yeah. 

M2: Mmm. 

M1: Does look like that. Yeah. 

F1: Yeah. 

M1: Shall we call it? There's no telephone number on there.

F1: There's no phone numbers on here.

M1: None on there.

M2: I can't see phone numbers anywhere.

M1: Not on here.

F1: I don't think we've done really well.

M1: Okay. So is there a phone number on here somewhere? No. 

M2: No phone numbers 
[00:01:25]: [anywhere?].
