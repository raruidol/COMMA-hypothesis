M1 [2023/05/12 19:07:00 GMT+0000]: Okay, so let's assume that this letter was sent by Cherie.

F1: Okay.

F2: Uh-huh.

M1: And this one was sent by Chris, no? They exchanged the letters?

F1: Okay, likely, yeah.

M1: But this was inside of the bag.

F1: But that's okay because they live…

M1: Maybe Nick found it.

F1: …yeah, they live in the same house.

M1: Yeah, maybe Nick found it. So, maybe that makes it easier to do the…no?

F1: Yeah, so…

F2: So, was that one in the…?

F1: …so, we now know what the F is, it's definitely C.

M1: Yeah, the F, or C, or T.

F1: Well, no, so like on this one, if it's from Cherie…

M1: Yes. So, that's why I think it makes sense to assume that they were exchanging these empty envelopes.

F2 [00:01:35]: Uh-huh.
