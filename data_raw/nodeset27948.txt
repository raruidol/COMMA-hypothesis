I was just trying to see if it says anything in here, because, she took photos right, and it says, where was it? 'On my way out I took a peak in his car, I noticed something that might be useful? So I don't know if she means the boots, or if there's something else.

F2: 	Well, I did like that question that you asked earlier, but I couldn't answer it.

F1:	Well, if it's not the boots, then I don't know what else it would be.

	I don't know.

F1:	It might be trying to put us off.

F2:	Yeah. 

F1:	Is she tall?

F2:	'I can see the devil in the woods, I'm just not fast enough to catch him.' So there is a suggestion that he thought that it was a man, but how tall is his wife?

F1:	Five foot seven.

F2:	Oh yeah.

F3:	Well, that's basically

[00:00:57]: [man height?].

F1:	I mean, that's not too short.

F3:	No, it's basically my height. I was the devil.

F4:	Is that a confession? Actuallyâ€¦

F1:	That's it, solved it. 

F4:	We can do that 

[00:01:12]: [inaudible] jumping out of the window.

F3:	[00:01:16]: [inaudible].

F1:	[00:01:18]: Oh my God.
