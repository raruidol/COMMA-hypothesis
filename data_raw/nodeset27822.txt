F1 [2023/05/17 15:09:16 GMT+0000]: Okay. Dead animals on his doorstep, fires that kept flaring up near the building. Someone was trying to scare him, maybe even to death. He was obsessed with figuring out who was to blame. In the bar's office for hours poring over security camera footage and scribbling notes. 

[00:00:26]: On the night he died, I'd just closed up when he came out of the office, said he'd finally figured it out. Before he could explain, he saw someone outside and ran off into the woods. Before he could blah. My back was to the door, I didn't see anyone. By the time I'd turned around both Nick and the devil were gone, and all that was left was a small fire burning outside. After I'd put it out, I waited for Nick, he didn't come back. 

[00:00:44]: After the death was ruled an accident, I went through and found all the notes he'd been keeping about the devil in a locked deposit bag I still haven't figured out how to open. I even found proof that the devil was real finally caught on camera, like Nick had been trying to do for months. 

[00:01:00]: I took the evidence to the sheriff, he didn't care that Nick was chasing after someone that night.
