Part 25:

M1	[2023/05/17 15:45:25 GMT+0000]: Oh.

M2:	So there's only two women. Right?

F1:	Yeah. No, there's three women. Sherry Webster, the wife. 

M1:	Joan Campbell, the…

F1:	Joan Campbell, the nutter. Or you are not allowed to say that. Joan Campbell, she's got issues. Donna Goddard. This is getting too 
[00:00:27]: [inaudible]. Donna Goddard. Donna Goddard, what 
[00:00:38]: [did she?]…?

M1:	Who is Donna Goddard again? I don't remember.

F1:	She's her.

M1:	Oh, yeah.

F1:	And we think she's got an alibi. Why? Why did we say she's…? Oh, she got a… No, no, she's not got an alibi. She has got a ticket at 3:31 in the morning.

M1:	Ah, yeah. Yeah.

F1:	So she's a big suspect, this one. And…talked to her about the night, that said she'd been having a rough time that night, was preoccupied. Then she said she'd decided to go for a drive and clear her thoughts, but only got worse from there. And then she said, oh, we shouldn't talk here. God.

M1:	Mmm. 

F1:	Right. Now we're onto the policeman. God, how long do normal people take to solve this? What did they say?

F2:	I'll tell you after. But, I mean, I wouldn't call those three particularly 
[00:01:32]: [normal?] either, so don't worry.

F1:	Do you think that we're doing really bad, or okay?

F2:	It's interesting. 
[00:01:39]: It's different.
