Part 11:

M1	[2023/05/17 15:23:33 GMT+0000]: That they thought he'd been dead for three hours by then.

F1:	Oh. 

M1:	Right?

F1:	Did I?

M1:	I say…I think you…

F1:	Oh, yeah, the Coroner said that. Coroner. Coroner, where is he? Blah, blah, blah, possible dead. Oh, Coroner. Where is that?

M1:	Was it in there? No? Wasn't it?

F1:	Oh, yeah. Here it is. Coroner arrived, agreed fall is likely cause of death, says he's probably been dead three to four hours.

M1:	Ah, no. Dead three to four hours at 7:30, say?

F1:	Yeah, but that's when he arrived.

M1:	Yeah? 

F1:	So that's when the call came in.

M1:	So seven…7:30…

F1	[00:00:36]:…[voices overlap] …

M1:	Yeah, but if the coroner then said he'd been dead three to four hours at…

F1:	Seven-thirty. That's still possible.

M1:	Seven…7:30. Minus, say…

F1:	Four hours.

M1:	Four hours.

R:	Three-thirty-one.

M1:	So that that's still a possibility. It doesn't rule out anything in that case. Yeah.

F1:	No. But she is…

M1:	Should we make an ACH matrix?

F1:	She is…

M1:	We should.

M2	[00:00:59]: [Inaudible].

M1	[00:00:59]: [We should?].

F1:	Okay. Nick Webster died at 6:37. Oh, okay. Between 6:37 and 7:30. Yeah?

M1:	Yeah. 

F1:	And she was stopped at 3:31. So she…

M1:	No, so he didn't die between then and then.

F1	[00:01:07]: He did.
