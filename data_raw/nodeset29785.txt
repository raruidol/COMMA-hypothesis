M1 [2023/05/12 18:33:30 GMT+0000]:	And what's this, Grey Investigations?

F1:	That's just the original introduction, and with an example of…

M1:	Ah, this is an example?

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Yeah.

M1:	And why do we have an example?

F1:	Because it says that, they would give an example of how to do a code.

M1:	Ah, okay, okay.

F1:	Yeah.

M1:	So, we have the code here, but we don't know the number that we have to shift, no, to…?

F2:	No.

F1:	That's it, yeah. 

M1:	Okay. 

F1:	So, I think what we need is…

F2:	On the poster, she's…

F3:	Watch your mike.

F1:	Thank you. Can I have my page back?

M1:	Yes.

F2:	Can I have another sheet, as well?

F3:	Yes, yeah.

F1:	Okay.

F2:	Thanks. On the poster for the ritual, it's got a complaint about the noise pollution. So, I'm wondering if that's anything to do with the other ones complaining about the loud music. 

F1:	Erm, I don't know. See, I'm kind of inclined to, like…

M1:	Yeah, you can copy it from here if it's going to be faster for you.

F1:	Okay, thanks.

F2:	Yeah, because we've got the time that the ritual was taking place, is 3.04. So, that means they were there before he left. So, the times do seem to match up, then. 

F1:	Erm…let's see. Okay.

M1:	Hmm, you…

F1:	Oh, I missed a bit, thank you. 

M1:	It looks like it's a question. Ah, maybe we can know the shift. This letter is sent by Chris?

F1:	No, to him.

M1:	Oh, to Chris, by…?

F1:	We don't know.

M1:	We don't know?

F1:	We don't know. Unless there's some kind of clue in the postcodes.

M1:	Because this is a, this looks like a signature.

F1:	Yeah, it's somebody's initials.

M1:	So, if we know the initial of the guy that sent this, we can break everything.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	Or, we need to figure out, like a word which has two letters the same.

M1:	I think that it's just to get who sent…

F2:	Yeah, if we have, like…

M1:	…wasn't there something about a letter explained there, or, like in the record?

F2 [00:04:00]:	Yeah, if you look for, like, repeating letters.
