	So, 'Dear Miss Gray', do we know who Miss Gray is?

F2:	I haven't got a Gray on my notes yet, although we've got a few neighbours and witches, so we've got a few un-named people.

F3:	So witnesses, would be Mia, right, and Helen G?

F2:	Yeah, Mia at the waterfall, and Helen G in the town.

F1:	We know the road name, right?

F2:	Oh yeah, I have Carmichael Road.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	But Helen doesn't live in that road, that was the person, that's where…

F1:	That's where the noise was though.

F2:	Yeah, the first noise.

F1:	Well some, the first noise, yeah. We don't know about Helen? Okay.

F3:	So what was here?

F1:	Just the complaints about noise and we're thinking 2.30 is maybe relevant.

F3:	Mmm. This is Dale Lynch. Dale Lynch, we've heard Dale Lynch.

F2:	Oh, Dale Lynch. Dale Lynch…

F1:	Is the council man.

F3:	The council man, what did he say?

F2:	Yes.

F3:	What did he say? Maybe try a sleep mask and earplugs 

[00:01:21]: [inaudible].

F1:	I know, weird for a council man to be like…

F3:	It's a small town, right?

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	[00:01:27]: But yeah, but okay.
