Part 32:

M1 [2023/05/17 15:56:15 GMT+0000]: Oh. Sorry. A fairly random thing. Nick Webster knew that Sherry was having an affair.

M2: Yeah.

F1: Oh, okay. 

M2: Sorry, I thought you'd already read that. I could have 
[00:00:37]: [said that?].

M1: No 
[00:00:38]: [inaudible]. I skipped the omission bit, interestingly enough.

F1: I think… So this is basically saying that…

M2: And this seems to be something about…

M1: Yeah. 

F1: This, is this basically saying that Sherry's wanting to do a deal behind her husband's back for the land?

M1: It looks like it.

F1: Yeah.

M1: But then in the end I think it doesn't…doesn't happen, does it?

F1: No, because on November the 8th… Sorry. Here we go, on October the 25th Sherry is saying to the developer, I'm so glad we were able to come to agreement, Nick and I just need a few weeks to put our affairs in order and then we should be able to finalise the deal. Then he gets back to her and said…then he…he, the developer, gets back to her a couple of weeks later and says, I appreciate that big decisions like this one take time, I hope to hear from you soon what the hell's happening. And so there's no contact after that. Maybe Nick finds out that Sherry is…

M1: Yeah.

F1: …planning to that.

M1 [00:01:54]: Yeah.
