F1:	Two thousand and four, so that was to figure out the year of their wedding.

F2:	Okay.

F1:	So that was to…

F3:	Figure out the date.

F2:	Okay. So I think, that's what I'm trying to think, where's a clue it hasn't…?

F3:	So should I maybe figure out this last bit, because that's the only bit that's that's missing.

	Oh, what's this photo for?

F1:	So I think it's to figure out boots, and I think it's probably these ones, and so far all we've figured out from it, is that there's men's boots and there's women's boots. But I don't know where this picture was taken, but number two, maybe we figure out an address?

F3:	So I think, those could be Joan's boots like outside of her porch, right, because…

F2:	They look like women's boots to me.

F1:	Yeah, they are women's, I think they're these ones which are, I don't know, one of these.

F3:	I think it's Joan. I think it belongs to Joan, I think it's her porch or something.

F2:	Oh…

F1:	Do we…can we check address, do these have addresses?

F2:	I was thinking, on her notes, did she say she took something, she took two things from someone's house, but she took something else from someone else's house.

F2:	[00:01:29]: [inaudible] doesn't look that promising, we're still waiting for the 

[00:01:30]: results…’
