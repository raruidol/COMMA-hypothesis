Part 94:

F2:	[2023/05/16 18:14:58 GMT+0000] Do we know who's her company?

F3:	What?

F2:	Building Bright Futures, that's never been mentioned has it? 

[00:00:22]: [inaudible].

F3:	Maybe in the article, maybe the other side of the article.

F2:	Yeah, I just wondered, I don't think I've written it down, I just wondered who she worked for.

F3:	'About land, Wednesday, Devil's Well, 11pm.' Oh no, but then she wouldn't have left a note, [fact?] 

[00:00:33]:, she wouldn't have left a note to meet him in the future, right, because she knew they were going to kill him? Oh shit, okay, my alibi isn't working anymore. Not alibi, my idea isn't working anymore.

	'About land'? 

F1:	I was just trying to find a link between her real estate company, and the one buying this, but I can't figure 

[00:00:50]: [anything else here?].

F3:	Yeah, no but then she would have…

F1:	Because she works for, I don't know, it says…

F2:	Let's say she was trying to sell the land to him, there was no incentive for her to kill someone, if she was going to find some…she was talking to the husband, not the wife 

[00:01:07]: [inaudible].

F3:	'Wednesday, Devil's Well, about land, 11pm.'

F1:	It might just be that she found out through the grapevine and…

F2:	Oh, she does say something odd. So she's crying a lot. 'We talked afterwards, just reminiscing, and then she said something really odd like, if only I'd been faster, maybe I could have made a difference.' So maybe whatever they were talking about here, could have made a difference. 

[00:01:43]: So I think she was helping him.
