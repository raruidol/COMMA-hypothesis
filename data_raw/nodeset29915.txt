F2: [2023/05/16 17:59:25 GMT+0000] Can I just, 'cause I'm out of the loop, what was this about, just to prove the cat story? What did this bring us?

F3: So this is the time when Donna started the meeting, for example, you know? Not Donna, Joan, sorry, started the meeting.

F2: This tells you when the protest was on.

F1: The witch, yeah.

F2: And so that gives her an alibi, 'cause she had a woman there at 3.30, and he was killed in that window. Okay. So this is an alibi for Donna really?

F3: Yeah. Joan, Joan, Joan, it's Joan.

F2: Joan, yeah.

F3: Donna doesn't have an alibi, she was there at 3.30 and Chris was there at 3.30. Cherie, apparently was with her friend, so she apparently has an alibi. 

F2: I can't see Donna's motive.

F1: Neither can I, did we miss something?

F3: He liked Donna.

F1: Yeah, I don't see Donna's motive, other than the inheritance thing, but it's not clear that she knew about it. 

F3: It was just for drinks.

F1: Oh, yeah, of course, it 

[00:00:35]: was just drinks for Donna, it was Carmen.

F3: Do you want to pick a suspect, just from the list of suspects, or going to say it's Carmen?

F4: [00:00:45]: Up to you.
