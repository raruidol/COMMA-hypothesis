Part 12
M1 [2023/05/12 18:43:00 GMT+0000]:	He had, what?

F1:	So, this complaint, it seems to be about his house, or it's probably about his house.

M1:	Uh-huh.

F1:	Because his address is 131 Carmichael Road.

M1:	Okay. But do we know the number, or…?

F1:	No. Okay, so…but she let herself in, which doesn't, which means maybe he wasn't there, possibly. But maybe he was there, I can't remember what it says. Oh, interesting. Okay, so that could definitely be, like, fake, right? If, because this woman doesn't say that she saw him at any point. Like, the girlfriend let herself in, and she turned on the lights.

F2:	Yeah, and you'd think…

F1:	He wasn't seen, yeah.

F2:	…yeah, if he was expecting her, she wouldn't have to turn on all the lights, like…

F1:	Yeah. So, we don't actually know where he was at the time.

F2:	Uh-huh. What time was that at exactly?

F1:	We don't…

M1:	They say, the noises were at two thirty.

F2:	Two thirty, yeah, so that's slightly before the timeslot, but…

M1:	Hmm.

F1:	But that means, he could have been gone, yeah.

F2:	Yeah. Yeah, so it says about Chris, that he said that he was helping Cherie with some stuff around the house, and just trying to be a friend in her time of need. 

F1:	Hmm, sounds fake.

F2:	Yeah. But also, it sounds like there's definitely something going on there.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Her time of need. 

F1:	I mean, it's her husband that got murdered, so.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	But is Chris' girlfriend actually Cherie, maybe. I don't know. Like, he seems trying, like, I don't know, he seems too happy to say that it wasn't murder. Like…

F2:	Yeah, like…

F1:	So, what did she actually take from his house, is it just this letter?

F2:	Yeah, I think so.

F1 [00:04:28]:	Okay.
