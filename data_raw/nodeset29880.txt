F2:	[2023/05/16 16:34:29 GMT+0000] Yeah, but let's say he was saying, I want to talk about the Wednesday meeting. It could have been the previous Wednesday's meeting, it might not be she wants to talk on Wednesday.

F1:	Or wants to talk about land, Wednesday, Devil's Well, 11pm. 

F2:	But he died on the Saturday.

F1:	Yeah, so he was already dead, but maybe about land, so about like the land with the…

F2:	One of my questions is, when was the council meeting, the controversial meeting?

F3:	Yeah.

F2:	Because if that was a Wednesday, that would be interesting, 'cause they might want to talk about the meeting. Meeting's…on Monday.

F1:	Oh Monday.

F3:	Monday would be December…no.

F1:	It would have been Monday the 9th, I think.

F2:	Okay.

F1:	Oh wait, did they mention anything there?

F2:	That's a Tuesday, so yeah, it must be the Monday meeting. Yeah, then they've reported it the next day, so it was the previous day. Okay, that was on the Monday, so it's nothing about the…that's not, so it's not Wednesday meeting, so that's fine, it's not that she wants to talk about.

F1:	Yeah, I think it's about land, when they say Devil's Well, 11pm, like this is time and place?

F2:	Yeah, I think so. And she's given a phone number, maybe, we don't know, but we'll leave this out.

F1:	Yeah, okay. But he never got the chance to see it, so…

F2:	[00:00:43]: Yeah.
