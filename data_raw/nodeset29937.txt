Part 109: 
F2:	[2023/05/16 18:36:15 GMT+0000] Yeah, we don't really know from the envelope, what time of day it is, but it's a clue, so we'll go with it. 
F3:	Nobody to support her alibi, that's opportunity. And she's fit, so she could run, and make her husband follow her. 
F1:	Yeah. 
F2:	And the other chap was working that night, he was pretty busy really, the boyfriend. 
F1:	Yeah. 
F3:	Okay, give us the envelope, we're done. 
F4:	Okay, so is that your final answer? 
F3:	Okay, so we're saying Chris is not involved. 
F2:	I think so. I think she's going to just, I don't think she's happy in that small town, she could have wiped her husband off, and is buggering off somewhere else.
 F3:	Okay. 
F1:	Yeah.
 F4:	Okay. 
F1:	That looks satisfying, do we not get to do it? 
F2:	I'm going to cry if we're wrong.

F1:	Ready. 
F2:	Oh yeah, that's right, we need a photograph, or it depends if it's right. Or at least… 
F4:	You'll need to read it out. 
F2:	Oh. 
F1:	Yeah, do I read this first? 
F3:	Yes. F4:	[00:01:40]: No, the paper.
