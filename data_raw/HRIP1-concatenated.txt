F1 [2023/05/12 18:19:00 GMT+0000]: Okay, this isn't putting anything together. But…so I think he died on the 7th of December, shortly after half past three in the morning. So, this is the person that he chased off into the wilderness, after which he died. So, that's good to know. It looks like, like if this person, Mia Rumer, is telling the truth, then it probably, it seems like there's an alibi for that crazy rich woman, but I don't know if that's the case. So… M1: Can I take this? F1: Yeah. So, I think, these are, am I right in thinking these are the four people? F2: Yeah, I think those are the suspects. F1 [00:01:55]: So, Donna, Joan, Chris… M1: Chris and Cherie. F1: …and Cherie. Okay. So, if Donna is the…no, not Donna, the other one…Joan. Okay, so, it seems like Joan is the one who is at this, the Devil thing. And so, she seems to be the person leaving, like, weird dead animals around. F2: Uh-huh. Is she also the one, then, protesting the sale of the land? F1: I think so. She…where's the newspaper gone? F2: Is it underneath? F1: We lost it. Or, do you have it? M1: I have the messages, and the, which one do you…? F1: There it is. M1: I have not yet read that. F2: Okay. Because she mentions the cause at the event on the 7th, in the woods. F1: So, we've got motive. I can't spell, opportunity. How many Ps are in opportunity? F2: I don't know. F1: So, have we found this opportunity. No, it's in the other one. There we go, there's two. Okay, so… F2: Yeah, so it looks like she has motive, but it doesn't look like she had the opportunity to do it. F1: Okay, so yeah, so she was at the, like, this is assuming that the message is accurate, but… F2: Yeah, and it's not, to cover the tracks. F1: Yeah, but probably, no. F2: Uh-huh. F1 [00:03:00]: Especially if the woman who posted the message says that she heard something at about the time that the murder happened.F2 [2023/05/12 18:25:03 GMT+0000]:	Yeah, I was just going to say, the last bit of the suspect notes, Joan is then saying about the boot treads. So, I was looking at them, and there's a couple of pictures, and it seems like that one matches with the, so like the triangle design, and then the bit outside. 

F1:	Uh-huh.

F2:	And then, in the, this is the shoes, I think that's result 12. Yeah, that's result number 12, which says it's a man's shoe.

F1:	Okay.

F2:	So…

F1:	Oh, yeah, so whatever the code is in that, I'm guessing is, the date you can't forget. 

F2:	Uh-huh.

M1:	I also noticed something here.

F1:	Ah, very interesting. Okay, yeah, can you see…?

F2:	Should we, like, hold something above it?

M1:	Can we…?

F1:	No, because you're going to have to use it again.

M1:	Yeah. Let's see…

F2:	Do we have, like a light we can shine underneath it, or something?

M1:	What was inside the letter?

F1:	I don't think there was anything inside it, I think it's just an envelope?

M1:	These, or it was just the envelope?

F1:	No, I think it was just the envelope.

F2:	What's this?

F1:	So, these are the victim's notes about weird stuff that's happened.

F2:	Oh, yeah, because then we've got a bit more of a timeline, as well.

M1:	Oh, we can do it this way, okay. 

F1:	Ah, there, okay. So, this is the thing that has to be decoded, then?

M1:	Yes, yes.

F1:	Okay. It looks like, also, that somebody who has this car may have an alibi. So, there was a traffic stop of somebody at 3.31a.m., so there's a good chance that they didn't make it for the time of the crime, if they…

M1:	Who's they?

F1:	Whoever has this car.

M1 [00:01:57]:	Okay.
F2 [2023/05/12 18:22:15 GMT+0000]:	Uh-huh. The only thing is, I was trying to work out the timings. Because if he died on the 7th, and the photo shows that he was still at the bar, I think it's at, like, half three, the person who attended that in the woods, apparently is back, and updating at, like, four a.m., and had heard him running past before. Because then, she went and put, like, the dead fox there.
F1:	Uh-huh.
F2:	So, she had to have put the animal there, and then got back home, and then, like updated on what happened. 

F1:	Okay. 

F2:	So, I don't know if the timings work out, but I don't know how we can sort of, like, check that. 

F1:	Oh, no, it's actually, it's 4.47. 

F2:	Oh, okay. 

F1:	So, that's probably enough time, actually. 

F2:	Yeah. 

F1:	If there's an extra hour, okay. So, somebody needs, so, someone told him they need to talk to him. 

M1:	Where is it, I cannot find the place in the message where it's John, or Cherie who said that they'd got an alibi. 

F1:	So, this seems like Joan. So, it's not explicit, but it looks like she's the person who organised this.
M1:	Uh-huh.
F1:	So, when she says there was only one other person there, probably the only other person was Joan. 

F2:	Uh-huh, and the other thing is, then, it says, the person who attended it says the person who organised it, believes she's a witch, and is casting a spell. 

M1:	Yeah.
F2:	And then in the suspect one, it says that Joan believes she's casting hexes on people. 

M1:	Hmm. 

F2:	And is talking about the evil corporation from there, that wants to buy Devil's Well. 

F1:	So, yeah, so… 

F2:	Yeah…go ahead.
F1 [00:02:45]:	No, no.F2 [2023/05/12 18:02:50 GMT+0000]:	It's on the back.

F1:	Okay, so I think…oh, okay, so this is an example of the codes. Okay, so…oh, god, we're going to have to write out the whole alphabet. I'm just going to do this for reference, because we're going to need to do it, like. Okay. [Writing]. Okay, I feel like, how many have we got, have we got participant – not participant – suspect profiles in here? This looks like…

M1:	Maybe, there, yeah.

F1:	This looks like one, or maybe this is all of them.

M1:	Yeah.

F1:	Okay. So, if people want to take things.

F2:	We also have the newspaper of the accident, and the letter that Carmen wrote…

F1:	Okay.

F2:	…as well, here.

F1:	Okay. So, do you want to read out that letter?

F2:	It might be quicker if we all just take turns reading it.

F1:	Okay.

M1:	Can I take this?

F1 [00:01:00]:	Yeah.

	[Reading documents].

F1 [00:15:10] : Yeah, so does anyone want to start talking about anything?
F2:	Erm…

M1:	We need to open this.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	Ah, I didn't even see that.

M1:	I think, erm…

F1:	Okay.

M1:	Maybe…

F1:	Yeah, there's a number on this. Okay, so, what does anyone know? Okay, well I'm just going to say some things.

F2 [00:16:08]:	Okay, go for it.
M1 [2023/05/12 18:33:30 GMT+0000]:	And what's this, Grey Investigations?

F1:	That's just the original introduction, and with an example of…

M1:	Ah, this is an example?

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Yeah.

M1:	And why do we have an example?

F1:	Because it says that, they would give an example of how to do a code.

M1:	Ah, okay, okay.

F1:	Yeah.

M1:	So, we have the code here, but we don't know the number that we have to shift, no, to…?

F2:	No.

F1:	That's it, yeah. 

M1:	Okay. 

F1:	So, I think what we need is…

F2:	On the poster, she's…

F3:	Watch your mike.

F1:	Thank you. Can I have my page back?

M1:	Yes.

F2:	Can I have another sheet, as well?

F3:	Yes, yeah.

F1:	Okay.

F2:	Thanks. On the poster for the ritual, it's got a complaint about the noise pollution. So, I'm wondering if that's anything to do with the other ones complaining about the loud music. 

F1:	Erm, I don't know. See, I'm kind of inclined to, like…

M1:	Yeah, you can copy it from here if it's going to be faster for you.

F1:	Okay, thanks.

F2:	Yeah, because we've got the time that the ritual was taking place, is 3.04. So, that means they were there before he left. So, the times do seem to match up, then. 

F1:	Erm…let's see. Okay.

M1:	Hmm, you…

F1:	Oh, I missed a bit, thank you. 

M1:	It looks like it's a question. Ah, maybe we can know the shift. This letter is sent by Chris?

F1:	No, to him.

M1:	Oh, to Chris, by…?

F1:	We don't know.

M1:	We don't know?

F1:	We don't know. Unless there's some kind of clue in the postcodes.

M1:	Because this is a, this looks like a signature.

F1:	Yeah, it's somebody's initials.

M1:	So, if we know the initial of the guy that sent this, we can break everything.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	Or, we need to figure out, like a word which has two letters the same.

M1:	I think that it's just to get who sent…

F2:	Yeah, if we have, like…

M1:	…wasn't there something about a letter explained there, or, like in the record?

F2 [00:04:00]:	Yeah, if you look for, like, repeating letters.
Part 11
F1 [2023/05/12 18:41:30 GMT+0000]:	So, if it was, then that would be, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, plus nine.

F2:	Yeah. So, will we try that?

F1:	So, one, two, three, four, five, six…no.

F2:	No.

F1:	Let's see, so let's see. What would the relationship between U and D would be…five, six, seven, eight, nine, plus S, would be minus two, that would be minus one. So, it would be…

M1:	Okay, so this was not relevant.

F1:	No.

F2:	Is it just like more instructions, or just like…

F1:	It's just a practice.

M1:	Yeah, it says, when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, might be the truth. Very beautiful, but it doesn't look like…

F1:	So, what was this one, then? I'm just going to…plus. What are you thinking? You look like you're actually writing something down.

M1:	Yes, yes, but no, it's just trying. Because, in English, after the apostrophe, it's an R, and then…?

F1:	But the R, I think the R should always have an E, as well, RE.

M1:	Hmm.

F1:	Yeah, and like, it seems cruel to also have spelling mistakes in there.

M1:	Yeah, yeah, no, I don't think, I don't think.

F1:	But the only things, the only ones we could think of, none of them work. Unless we're forgetting a letter. Like, yeah, S, T, and D are the only ones we could think of, but those don't work for the other letters. Okay, this was meant to, like, like help us cheat, but it's actually not working. Not cheat, but you know. Oh, that's interesting, okay, ooh. 

F2:	What's this, what are you looking for?

F1:	It is…okay. So, Chris lives on Carmichael Road, so he's the one who had a girlfriend sneak in really late, on that night. 

F2 [00:01:55]:	Uh-huh.
F1: Yeah. So, okay, so U needs to be something that is, like you could have an apostrophe, so it's either, like D, S, is there anything else? F2: T. F1: T. F2: Yeah, and it's also followed there, isn't it, so it needs to be the beginning of a two letter word, as well. F1: So, like we, do, so, to. F2: Yeah. F1: So… F2: But there's a UP, and a UH, is there, at the end, there? F1: So, I'm going to guess that P is O, because that’s the only vowel that could be the second vowel in one of those words. F2: Yeah. F1: So, what did I say…O. So, that would be just one, so that would be T. Okay, so if you move about, like, one. No, that doesn't work, aagh. F2: Hmm. F1: Because otherwise it would be…okay. Is that definitely two Ds? Yeah, hmm. Oh, I wish I had a pencil. Okay, erm… F2: If we go with F, because there's VFF, so what's a three letter word that has two…? F1: Yeah, the only other thing is, I wonder, I mean, I guess it's always possible that there's more than one in there, but that seems too complicated. F2: The other thing is, are we taking the spaces as, like actual spaces, or is it just sort of like…? F1: Hmm. Probably, like, they look like they're grouped into words. F2: Yeah. F1: Yeah, I don't know, I feel like the real puzzle is, what the hell the first word is. F2: Yeah. F1: Because, like, what word starts with two of the same letter? F2 [00:40:00].: Yeah, and ends with an apostrophe, something. F1: Okay. So…no progress. Like, this seemed like a really, it was going to go somewhere. F2: Yeah. I'm just thinking, F could be O. If it's like, two, or something. F1: Yeah. F2: But I'm not sure about any of the rest of them. Part 7
F1 [2023/05/12 18:30:01 GMT+0000]:	So, where is the…oh, yeah, okay, hang on, oh hang on, okay. So, Nancy, whoever Nancy is. So, I wonder if, what's his name, the dead guy…

F2:	Yeah, Nick.

M1:	Nick.

F1:	…Nick, was he possibly cheating on his wife?

F2:	I was wondering that, and I was wondering why Carmen is the one who knows everything, and has all the notes. 

F1:	So, you see, she, so do we know where he lives? Oh, maybe the address is in the wife's…

F2:	Yeah, it'll be the wife's address.

F1 :	No, she lives in [inaudible].

F2:	Okay.

M1:	And what's this?

F2:	I don't know. I was going to say, though, if I can find it again…yeah, so Donna is the one who left the note on the menu, and a matchbox on the counter. But he didn't actually see them.

F1:	Oh, so where's that?

F2:	There, just the fourth bullet-point. And she says [voices overlap].

F1 :	Ah, okay. So, this is her, so this is Donna...

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	…p.m.., next Wednesday.

F2:	I'm assuming that's, like, the code we need to break, is what's on the menu.

M1:	So, this was left by Donna?

F2 [00:01:58]:	Yes.Part 8
F1 [2023/05/12 18:32:00 GMT+0000]:	Well, it sounds like she knows some kind of secret.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	So, we need to talk about Devil's Well, about the land on Devil's Well, on Wednesday, at 11p.m.

F2:	Yeah.

M1:	Okay.

F1:	So, maybe she was planning…

M1:	So, they talked, there was time, they met in the bar, and they talked about that?

F2:	No, she left the note, I think. Yeah, so, she left a note on her menu, and the matchbox on the counter for Nick, but he never got the chance to see it.

M1:	Oh, okay. But he says that, he knows who's behind the threats, and everything?

F2:	Yeah.

M1:	Okay.

F1:	So, maybe multiple people were threatening him, and she knows about a different one?

F2:	Yeah.

M1:	Where did you get the coding stuff? I remember there was a paper.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	Oh, yeah, but I think it was basically just explaining that you moved the alphabet.

F2:	But should we just do it to see what it actually says, in case there's anything useful?

F1:	Yeah.

M1:	Yeah.

F2:	Is this the threatening note, or…?

F1:	Yeah, so that's the threatening note on the poster.

M1:	Yeah, I wrote it down, here.

F1:	Oh, good.

M1:	But the thing is that we don't know because…okay.

F1:	Okay, so we need something…okay. Right, can I…oh.

M1:	Yes, I was going to use it.

F1:	Oh, okay. Do we have another page? I can rip my page up, because I would also like to try it.

M1:	Do you have one more paper?

F3 [00:01:25]:	I can get some.
F2:	What is the vehicle? 
F1:	Erm, Lincoln…what is it…silver. 
 F2:	Is it that one? 
 F1:	Silver Lincoln, 2015, yeah. 
F2:	Yeah.

F1:	Okay, so…

F2:	That's Donna. 
F1:	…so, Donna was stopped by police… 
M1:	Uh-huh. 
F1:	…at 3.31a.m. 
F2:	Uh-huh. 
F1:	So, we probably didn't find her…oh. 
M1:	At 3.31… 
F2:	It says, she's the last person to leave the bar, but there's someone else in the security photo. 
M1:	Yeah, there's…

F1:	That's true. 
F2:	So, she can't have been driving the car, if she's pictured in the bar, at the same time. 
F1:	Was she in there on that night, or is that just in general? 
F2:	Well, it says, last person to leave the bar the night Nick died, left maybe an hour before closing, which is, like, her. 
M1:	No, but the last person would be, Carmen, the girl that sends…? 
F1:	I don't think she was there. 
M1:	No? 
F2:	No, I think she's just, has heard about this going on, and then thinks the death is suspicious. 
M1:	Oh, okay. Okay, okay. 
F2:	And then, like gathered his notes, and stuff. Yeah, do you have, is that the one there? 
F1:	Yeah, so, and it's also, I don't know if it's relevant, it mentions the body being called in half three, or six. 
F2:	Yeah. Yeah, so we have, like the last sighting is at 3.33, and then it's found at half six, so there's, like, three hours. 
F1:	Yeah. So… 
M1:	No, it says, on the night he died, I just closed up when he came out of the office… 
F1:	Ah, you're right, she was there. 
F2:	Yeah. 
M1:	…and said, he'd finally figured it out. Hmm, but maybe this is before, this is, at what time is the, like, the official time of the murder, there is no…? 
F2:	We don't know.

F1:	We don't know.

F2:	There's, like, three hours, it could have been. 
M1:	Okay, uh-huh. 
F2:	And do we know who wrote the notes on the suspects, is this the sheriff, or the deputy sheriff? 
F1:	I don't know. 
F2:	But we've found, definitely then, conflicting information, that the suspect list says that Donna was the last, or no, it says, Donna was the last to leave the bar. Does it say that, what does Carmen say in her letter, does she say that she's the last to leave, or does she say that…? 
F1:	But she could have been the last patron to leave, but not the last person. 
F2:	Yeah. 
 M1:	Yeah, that's probably, yeah.

F2:	Yeah.F1 [2023/05/12 18:55:00 GMT+0000]:	Yeah, so like, where is her mother?

F2:	That's a good question. 

F1:	Like…

F2:	Yeah, I just noticed, as well, on Donna's one, it's saying that they tried to call her and there was no answer, they called her office and they said she left on a business trip, not sure when she's supposed to get back. But she was supposed to be meeting Nick on the Wednesday.

F1:	So, but that could be that she, like if she felt like she had to warn him about something, and then he got murdered, that she was like, I'm not going back.

F2:	Yeah.
F1:	And she's probably in the clear because of…

M1:	Who is, she?

F1:	Donna is probably clear…

M1:	Donna.

F1:	…because of the 3.30 parking thing.

M1:	Yeah, the police stuff, yeah.

F2:	Uh-huh.

F1:	Yeah, okay, so I feel like Chris and Cherie are now looking the most suspicious.

F2:	Yeah. I think that they both…

M1:	And with Joan, we know from these that she was not in the, at this event.

F1:	Yeah.

M1:	But that was close to the murder scene.

F1:	Yeah. So, it was close, but the woman reported on it also said she heard something else in the distance around half three. So, that…

M1:	In the social network?

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	So, which seems to me that, whoever, like Nick and the murderer is what she heard.

M1:	Yeah.

F2:	Uh-huh.

F1 [00:01:00]:	At the same time that she could see Joan, so it wasn't her.
Part 15
F2 [2023/05/12 18:53:30 GMT+0000]:	Uh-huh. I was just going to say, the last point on Chris, is saying that he showed up at the house, and was banging on the door, and accusing of theft, and threatening to press charges. So, it sounds like he really did not want that letter to be found.

M1:	Hmm. But no, but would, like the guy from the agency stole it, it's not a, like a sheet from the notebook, or it's a letter?

F2:	I think it's just the envelope.

M1:	Like just the envelope, okay, I misunderstood it, then.

F2:	Yeah, because it says that, they visited him at home, and brought pizza, and then was snooping around in the kitchen, and stole an opened envelope that was at the bottom of the pile of mail on the table.

M1:	Ah, okay.

F2:	So, I think that's what he's then accusing of stealing, but it doesn't actually specify that.

M1:	Okay.

F1:	So, I just noticed something weird. So, the police officers says that they, when they went to Cherie, they made sure that she called her mother, to get her mother to come down and stay with her, so she wouldn't be alone. But, here, she hasn't called her mother, and instead, this guy is there. It's very suspicious.

M1:	The guy is, where?

F2:	Where is this?

F1:	So, the wife, so the police officer says that, they told Cherie that he had been murdered, and then they said, they made sure…

M1:	He, you mean, Nick?

F1:	Yeah. So, yeah, she's his wife. The police officer broke the news and told her, and they know she did it.

F2:	I've just realised, Cherie says that she was staying at a friend's house the night Nick died, so she could be the one that was at Chris' house.

M1:	Oh, that's true, that's true, yeah, that's true.

F1:	Yeah, so that also means that there's some kind of motive involved, possibly. Okay.

F2:	And she also denies that it was a murder.

F1:	Convenient.

F2 [00:01:28]:	Yeah.M1 [2023/05/12 18:51:00 GMT+0000]:	And do we know those boots, who they belong to?

F1:	This one, I don't think we do know. 

M1:	But this one, we do?

F1:	We're guessing.

F2:	We're guessing.

M1:	You are guessing, okay, we don't know for sure?

F1:	No.

F2:	No.

M1:	No.

F1:	But we're guessing that this is the useful thing she saw, in his car, which is, so…

M1:	He has a Toyota?

F2:	Yes.

M1:	Okay. 

F1:	He has two cars. But one of them is a Toyota.

M1:	Okay. And these, do we know, what is this photo taken?

F2:	I think that's supposed to be like the crime scene, but I'm not sure.

M1:	Okay, so there is no information about…?

F2:	No, they were sitting with the shoe guide, but there was no other information with it.

M1:	Okay, so we have a link between this boot, which probably because it's a Toyota name on there, on the picture, and this box, because this is…?

F1:	Well, that might be a different one, that might just have been found, whereas this one, we think was left by Donna. So, like, they're separate ones, but they're the same.

M1:	And why, like, if this comes from the detective agency, who don't we have for this one?

F1:	Good question. But it might be that he dropped that one himself. Because that's his box, and this was the one from her. 

M1:	Uh-huh.

F1 [00:02:15]: Yeah, is there a…yeah, that's a good question, though.
Part 13
F2 [2023/05/12 18:47:30 GMT+0000]:	She says, she took a peek in his car and noticed something that might be useful, but it doesn't, like…

F1:	Oh, maybe it's the, the through the back seat picture, maybe this is his…

F2:	Oh, that's the boots that match the footprint.

F1:	Or is this a window, is this a car?

F2:	I'm not sure.

F1:	It looks a bit like a car. 

F2:	Yeah, because like…

F1:	Yeah, maybe this is, yeah, look, it says, Toyota.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	Okay.

M1:	Hmm.

F1:	So, these are his boots. 

F2:	Uh-huh.

F1:	And you already said, you think…

M1:	And where were these photos?

F2:	They were with the shoes guide.

M1:	Oh, there is a shoes guide, okay.

F2:	Yeah, so I think they match the ones in the picture, and I think they're result 12. 

F1:	And they are…where's the thing about the car? 

F2:	Yeah, here.

F1:	Yeah, so maybe, so this is what she thinks might be useful, or we think?

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	Okay, this is not looking good for him.

F2:	No.

M1:	Can I see that?

F1:	Yeah. Okay, I'm going to put this over here, with you.

F2 [00:03:28]:	Yeah, and then…Part 17
F2 [2023/05/12 18:56:10 GMT+0000]:	Did someone say that Nick, like, chased after the one in the devil's mask, yeah?

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	So, the woman, there, then could have heard a chase, which would be them.

F1:	Yeah. Okay. So, like, I feel like this is narrowing down.

F2:	Yeah. 

M1:	What about, what is this thing about that they hear some other noise?

F1:	Yeah, 30, 40 minutes, at one point I heard something crashing around.

M1:	Oh, okay, okay. I got worried…okay, okay, so hmm.

F1:	This could, maybe this is also the thing that she stole. Is this all possibly…I don't know if we know where that's from.

M1:	Yes, that was explained…

F2:	I think this is…	

M1:	…that was explained in…

F2:	…yeah, is it in the initial letter?

M1:	…in the initial letter, yeah.

F2:	Yeah. 

F1:	Okay, I'm going to put these together.

M1:	Yes. 

F1:	It's very weird the date is, month, month, year. Like, how do you know what the other number of the year is, like…?

F2:	You only need three numbers.

F1:	Yeah, but that's what I mean, it's like…

F2:	Oh, yeah.

F1:	…years are normally two numbers.

F2 [00:00:50]:	Yeah, I know.Part 12
M1 [2023/05/12 18:43:00 GMT+0000]:	He had, what?

F1:	So, this complaint, it seems to be about his house, or it's probably about his house.

M1:	Uh-huh.

F1:	Because his address is 131 Carmichael Road.

M1:	Okay. But do we know the number, or…?

F1:	No. Okay, so…but she let herself in, which doesn't, which means maybe he wasn't there, possibly. But maybe he was there, I can't remember what it says. Oh, interesting. Okay, so that could definitely be, like, fake, right? If, because this woman doesn't say that she saw him at any point. Like, the girlfriend let herself in, and she turned on the lights.

F2:	Yeah, and you'd think…

F1:	He wasn't seen, yeah.

F2:	…yeah, if he was expecting her, she wouldn't have to turn on all the lights, like…

F1:	Yeah. So, we don't actually know where he was at the time.

F2:	Uh-huh. What time was that at exactly?

F1:	We don't…

M1:	They say, the noises were at two thirty.

F2:	Two thirty, yeah, so that's slightly before the timeslot, but…

M1:	Hmm.

F1:	But that means, he could have been gone, yeah.

F2:	Yeah. Yeah, so it says about Chris, that he said that he was helping Cherie with some stuff around the house, and just trying to be a friend in her time of need. 

F1:	Hmm, sounds fake.

F2:	Yeah. But also, it sounds like there's definitely something going on there.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Her time of need. 

F1:	I mean, it's her husband that got murdered, so.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	But is Chris' girlfriend actually Cherie, maybe. I don't know. Like, he seems trying, like, I don't know, he seems too happy to say that it wasn't murder. Like…

F2:	Yeah, like…

F1:	So, what did she actually take from his house, is it just this letter?

F2:	Yeah, I think so.

F1 [00:04:28]:	Okay. 
Part 18
F1 [2023/05/12 18:57:01 GMT+0000]:	But, like, there's multiple decades, because people are born in different decades, and this isn't a different decade, so which year is it?

F2:	Well, if it's month, month, yeah, the first number is either a zero or a one.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	So, but yeah, we need the next year.

F1:	We need some kind of clue about what the year is, like…

F2:	Yeah, because on the…

F1:	So, actually, maybe that means it is something in the 2000s, if there's only one digit for the year. When did…?

F2:	Does it say, like, when the pub was opened, or anything, or, like any dates?

F1:	Maybe in the newspaper.

M1:	The date.

F1:	Okay, 57, okay, well that's…

M1:	Fifty-seven. Have you found the, like in the letter, where was that stuff found?

F2:	Erm, no. Yeah, so she found all the notes he'd been keeping about the devil in a locked deposit bag, I still haven't figured out how to open.

M1:	So, what was owned by Nick?

F2:	Yeah, but she only found it there, so…

M1:	Okay.

F1:	Okay, and this, yeah, and this is his writing, so…

F2:	So, yeah, so I think it's the last bit of his notes is saying, he's figured it out.

F1:	Yeah. What is the date that he can't forget? Okay, so what is, this is, basically, probably…

M1 [00:01:44]: Can I take these notes?Part 22
M1 [2023/05/12 19:04:52 GMT+0000]: It's three numbers, and it says, month, month.
F2: Yeah, month, month, year. But, like… 
F1: And none of the years worked? 
F2: …it should be like something in-between 2000 and 2010. 
F1: All of them. 
F2: I tried five and seven with all of the months, because that's the year on the thing. 
M1: Have you tried 11, 4? 
F2: I don't think so. I'll try it…yes.
F1: Yes. M1: It was 11, 4?F2: Yeah. 
M1: Ah, nice. 
F1: Okay, ha ha ha. Oh, right, yeah okay, excellent. 
M1: What's that? 
F2: Is it divorce papers? 
F1: So, no, it's more motivation for Cherie. So, it's emails about, so it's about, I think them selling the bar to the developers. And in the profile she says that she couldn't possibly be reopening it and she will sell it.

M1: Okay. 
F1: Yeah, okay, she totally has…so, will I just read it? 
F2: Yeah.
 M1: And this is another one? 
F2 [00:00:52]: Yeah, there's a will.
Part 23 F1 [2023/05/12 19:05:55 GMT+0000]: Oh, yes. Okay, so the emails. F2: Yeah, so he's not leaving anything to his wife. F1: Hmm. F2: So… F1: So, yeah, his best friend, his, like, best employee, and an apology to that crazy woman. F2: Yeah, and he's saying, I thought you at least still cared for me, and I was a fool to think so, but better a fool than a liar, I guess. F1: Yeah. So, this email is basically her saying that they're going to sell, which he says they're not. M1: Who is, her? F1: Cherie. M1: Cherie, okay. F1: So, let's do this backwards. Erm…yeah, she says she can't shake the feeling that something terrible will happen to him. F2: Hmm. M1: Okay. F1: And she's confirming that they're going to sell it. And then, the guy that she was talking to emailed Nick. So, that is probably the first time that he found out that. F2: Yeah. F1: So, like, I think, yeah, she was going behind his back to say that they were going to sell, which means that she knew he was going to be killed, I think. F2: Uh-huh. And also, he's saying, the first one, that he's leaving £5,000 to the Save the Devil's Well Foundation. F1: Yeah, so that's like actively anti-selling it. F2: Yeah, it's not just he didn't know that she was planning for them to sell it, it's, he's completely against it. F1 [00:00:50]: Yeah.Part 24:

M1 [2023/05/12 19:07:00 GMT+0000]: Okay, so let's assume that this letter was sent by Cherie.

F1: Okay.

F2: Uh-huh.

M1: And this one was sent by Chris, no? They exchanged the letters?

F1: Okay, likely, yeah.

M1: But this was inside of the bag.

F1: But that's okay because they live…

M1: Maybe Nick found it.

F1: …yeah, they live in the same house.

M1: Yeah, maybe Nick found it. So, maybe that makes it easier to do the…no?

F1: Yeah, so…

F2: So, was that one in the…?

F1: …so, we now know what the F is, it's definitely C.

M1: Yeah, the F, or C, or T.

F1: Well, no, so like on this one, if it's from Cherie…

M1: Oh, sorry, yeah, it's C or W.

F1: Yeah, but I don't think people would sign off with their surname.

M1: Yeah, I don't think that either, but just to try.

F2: So, did that one come out of the locked bag?

F1: So, yeah, I think so. 

M1: Sorry?

F2: Yeah, so did that one come out of the locked bag, yeah?

M1: Yes. So, that's why I think it makes sense to assume that they were exchanging these empty envelopes.

F2 [00:01:35]: Uh-huh.Part 26:

F1 [2023/05/12 19:11:50 GMT+0000]:	So, 407 is, ENF. What does that, so what is that, right?

F2:	But like, they all have to be shifted by the same to actually work out any of them, don't they?

F1:	Or, are they 407407?

F2:	Maybe.

F1:	Can I see the, this one? Right, the second one is, oh my god, it's super long.

F2:	Uh-huh.

F1:	ENF. So…I don't know. No, that's, wait, plus, minus…no, I can't remember what I'm actually doing. Okay, E minus four is, one, two, three, four. E plus four is, one, two, three, four, okay. F, one, two, three, four, five, six seven, is Y. F plus seven is, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, erm…so, possibly, I need four, one, two…wait, no, one, two, three, four, T, I, 7…one, two, three…no…one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Ah-ha.

F2:	Have you got it?

F1:	I might. So, four…

M1:	So it's repeated, 407, 407?

F1:	…one, two, three, four, yeah, I've got it. So, any time…this is going to take a while…but it's working. That's two real words.

F2:	We're getting there.

F1:	We're going to get there. Right, so we just need to write out this entire thing.

M1:	You have it here.

F1:	Okay. So, we need to go…

M1:	Any time…

F1:	…yeah, any time. So, I think we need to go over this, so 407, 407, 407, over and over.

M1:	Yes, 407, 407, 407, 407, 407…

F1:	So, P, W, H, P, X…okay, okay. Okay.

M1:	I thought you were decoding, like, real time.

F1:	Oh, yeah, yeah. So, this is minus, so, one, two, three, four, E has become A. So, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And then, seven has to become Y, or F becomes M. F becomes, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven…is that right?

F2:	Is it not that way?

F1:	I did it the wrong way round. Yeah.

F2 [00:01:40]:	Yeah.
Part 20
F1 [2023/05/12 19:02:10 GMT+0000]:	Okay, so hang on, so I think that those shoes might be Joan's, because her address is 2 County Road, and you can see a 2. So…

F2:	Let's see if I can…

F1:	…I think they're probably not useful.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	They're just like, other shoes. 

F2:	Plus, she would have been out there anyway.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	But we're still ruling her out of the mix. 

F1:	Okay, so, if we say, Chris and Cherie both had a motive, because it seems like they were involved with each other.

F2:	Uh-huh.

F1:	Cherie didn't have opportunity because the neighbours heard her.

M1:	But that was one hour earlier.

F1:	But then it says, she…

F2:	Yeah, it doesn't say she left, it was…

M1:	Erm, that's true. But the discussion in the thread was about the noise, not about leaving, so.

F2:	Yeah, so…

F1:	So, probably in Chris' house.

M1:	We are not a hundred per cent sure.

F1:	But we don't know how they did it. So, yeah, I feel like Chris is missing in action. Cherie was probably at his house, Donna was, like, had the traffic, had the police stop, Joan seems to have been at the ritual. So I'm, like, I don't know what means it would have even been, because it's just like he just got pushed off a cliff.

F2 [00:01:05]:	Yeah. I know it mentions…
M1 [2023/05/12 19:13:32 GMT+0000]:	It's working, hey?

F1:	Yeah. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, so that's Y. 

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	So, Z. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, okay. Have you got it?

M1:	Almost, almost, yeah. 

F1:	So…okay. So, like, we've totally got them. This is probably a seven. No, erm…okay. Any time we're just us without your old man in the way. Okay, so…

M1:	Okay, so this was sent by Chris to Cherie?

F1:	Yeah. So, this is…

M1:	Now, this is the same, probably.

F1:	Probably.

M1:	This is probably going to be, 407, 407, 407, 407…

F1:	Unless it is 131.

M1:	Oh, that could also make sense. Yeah, that would also make sense.

F1:	So, what if we did 131? So, what would that look like? So, C, so like, minus, would it be that?

M1:	No, 131, it's not, because C is at…

F1:	No, look, so C, one, two, three, A, O…can.

M1:	Yeah, so it's that.

F1:	Can't, ah-ha, can't wait…one, three, one, one, three, one, three, one, one, three, one, one, three, one, one, three, okay. So, can't wait – this is going to be wait – can't wait to see you, yeah. Can't wait to see you, erm…no, I think I did something, I think I did…G…mind…I, F, L…what? Oh, maybe, is there a space there? One, one, three, one, C…oh, we might have a weapon, U, T…mind if I borrow the…oh, it's just, car.

F2 [00:07:28]:	Uh-huh.

F1:	Can't wait to see you, mind if I borrow the car. What is it, one, three, one, one, three, one, one, three…there you go…again. Okay.

M1:	So, what does it say?

F1:	Can't wait to see you, mind if I borrow the car again.

M1:	Okay.

F1:	Okay. Okay, like, we know it's them, right?

F2:	Yeah.

M1:	Well…

F1:	I mean, we're pretty sure it's him.

M1:	…it's suspicious but we don't have the…

F1:	The means.

F2:	The means.

M1 [00:08:38]:	Yeah.
Part 30:

F3 [2023/05/12 19:24:55 GMT+0000]: Are you giving your final answer?

M1: We have to give one name, no?

F3: I don't know.

M1: I mean, we are pretty sure about two of them, but who is the actual murderer?

F1: Erm, I would be willing to say that it was Chris.

M1: Yeah, me too, but…

F2: Yeah.

F1: But I'd be willing to say that, like, if pushed, I would say – ha-ha, if pushed – him, by himself. Because, where has the thing gone…

M1: So, what do we have to say, what's the output of this stuff?

F2: Do we just tell you our guess?

F3: I guess, yeah. So, like, why, who, how, I guess.

M1: So, it's a name?

F3: Yeah.

F2: Uh-huh.

M1: One unique name?

F1: I'm saying, Chris.

F3: I haven't seen the answers, so I don't know.

F2: Yeah.

F1: I'm saying, Chris.

M1: Okay.

F2 [00:01:05]: Uh-huh.Part 28:

F1 [2023/05/12 19:22:12 GMT+0000]:	What is the report?

F2:	That's her car, and then it's, where's the…?

F1:	Did they like, did they…no, because they chased him through the woods.

F2:	Yeah.

M1:	So, apart from…

F1:	So, I'm…

M1:	…the letter, what was inside the bag, this mail, and which…?

F2:	The will.

F1:	The will.

M1:	The…and this, okay. I want to check this, now.

F1:	Now, I feel like I'm ready to call it, for him. 

F2:	Uh-huh.

F1:	Like, I know it's not airtight, but…

F2:	The only thing is, the boots are in the back of his car, not her car. Like, there doesn't seem to be anything about her car, does there?

F1:	No. But that one is Donna's car.

F2:	Yeah. And the other one is his Toyota.

F1:	Unless there's another one, oh…no collision, dead body, no. Suspicious person, traffic stop…no, nobody has a red Honda, do they?

F2:	I don't think so.

F1:	Yeah, this might just be random extra stuff earlier in the night. Yeah.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	Yeah, like, the only…I don't know if we have a, can we just double check the, we can just double check the, like, reports, maybe, of like, what she says. Okay, so yeah, it just says that he was pushed off, so he doesn't really need a means other than being there.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	I think it was him.

F2 [00:00:53]:	Uh-huh.Part 32: F1 [2023/05/12 19:30:00 GMT+0000]: [is given piece of paper with answer] Should we…oh my god. No. F3:	Read it out. F1:	Okay. M1:	Yeah, read it, read it. F1:	Okay. The death of Old Scratch tavern owner, Nicholas Webster has been re-classified as a murder according to official paperwork filed this week. Though Webster's death, though his death was initially ruled an accident, the case was recently reopened as a homicide. Sheriff Paul McGinty confirmed a suspect is now in custody in connection with Webster's death. Cherie Webster, the victim's widow, has been charged with the murder of her husband. The motive of which is believed to be financial gain. The Sheriff's Office announced there will be an external enquiry into their handling of the investigation. While Sheriff McGinty would not discuss the scope of this enquiry, he did confirm that Deputy Christopher Thomson, the officer in charge of the original investigation, has been suspended without pay.

	According to Carmen Rojas, an employee at the bar Mr Webster owned, the case was solved thanks to new evidence uncovered by a private investigator. None of this would have happened without the help of Grey Investigations, she said, I'll always be grateful to the investigator who worked my case. Okay. Phew, but how, where was he, he has no alibi? F2:	Yeah, that seems like it's, like they don't want to, like… F1:	He has no alibi. M1:	But she didn't either. F1:	No, but she at least has been spotted. F2:	Uh-huh. M1:	Yeah, we got that, yeah. F1:	So, like, we don't, like, so yeah, we didn't see her leave, but no one saw him, even once. M1:	Yeah, but we missed something, yeah.F1:	We did. M1:	It's…yeah. F1 [00:01:15]:	Aagh.F2 [2023/05/12 19:31:17 GMT+0000]:	But that's still, like, they're still saying that he's suspended without pay, so he's definitely…

F1:	Yeah, so he colluded.

F2:	Yeah.

M1:	Yes, but he's not the murderer.

F1:	No, it's her.

F2:	Yeah.

M1:	So, that's the connection that I was saying that we were not finding, like…

F1:	Yeah.

M1:	…between what happened when she went into the apartment, and the murder. And where was he, no, because we don't know where he was.

F1:	We don't know where he was.

F2:	The only thing that indicates it, is that there is evidence pointing to him, rather than her.

M1:	Yes.

F2:	And, I don't know if we missed something somewhere.

F1:	So, like, he was the one in the mask, but like, how did she get out of there?

M1:	Do you know it, or not?

F3:	No, I don't.

F1:	Aagh.

F3:	This is very exciting.

F2:	We want answers.

F1:	Yeah, I need answers.

F3:	I'll let you know when the other people next week do it.

M1:	We don't deserve this paper.

F1:	We don't deserve this. I mean, I'm not…

M1:	Because that's a congratulations.

F3:	Yeah.

F1:	…I'm not saying that we picked a, you know, I think we, you know.

F1 [00:01:08]:	He's not an innocent man, but I don't understand how, like…

F2:	Yeah. 

M1:	But in the end, we say the name based on a guess, not based on having the…

F1:	Yeah, we didn't have perfect evidence.
Part 31: F3 [2023/05/12 19:26:05 GMT+0000]:	Okay. How, and why? F1:	How, yeah, that is the only thing is, because it says specifically that he died from a fall. F3:	Uh-huh. F1:	So, it seems like the how has been answered. F3:	Uh-huh. F1:	Like, it seems like what he had to do was draw him into the woods alone, where he could… F2:	Yeah, near the cliff, and then just shove him off. F1:	…and like, just push, shove him off. Which it doesn't seem very satisfactory, but I don't think that we've found anything else about another method, or like, anything else that would…yeah. F2:	Yeah, it says… F1:	Also, the fact that, so he's in the hiking club, so he knows, probably, the countryside around the place quite well. F2:	It also says that the coroner agreed that a fall is the likely cause of death, so. F1:	Yeah, so I think that is the method. Especially if he knows, like, knows the hills, or whatever. And, yeah, the motive is because he is cheating, he's… M1:	Having an affair with… F1:	…he's having an affair with Cherie. M1:	Yeah. F1:	Who is not really happy in her marriage. F2:	Uh-huh. F1:	And she wants to sell the bar, and get out. F3:	Okay. If you're happy with that? F1:	And also, it does, and also, it kind of explains why the Sheriff's office is dismissing the case, because he works there. F2:	Uh-huh. F3:	Okay. F1:	Yeah. F3:	Good? F2:	He's the deputy, isn't he? F1:	Uh-huh. F2:	Yeah. So, it was like saying in the newspaper, or whatever, he was the one that just lived at the bottom of the cliff, rather than the top of the cliff. F3:	Okay? F1 [00:03:25]:	Okay. Part 19
F1 [2023/05/12 18:58:55 GMT+0000]:	Yeah. So, there's his notes on his stuff that he, his threats. Okay. This is probably, we can clear, this probably, we can clear, this probably, we can clear. This probably we can clear, because it's just the picture with the time and date on it. These are just introductions.

M1:	And this is also written by Nick?

F1:	Yeah, I think so. Let me see, this is the shoes, I think, I feel like we have matched the shoes, right? No, you can't really make out a second one. Oh, can I see that for a second?

M1:	What?

F1:	The, his notes, just for a second.

M1:	Yeah.

F1:	Maybe a different…this one.

M1:	Okay.

F1:	Wait. So, sorry, I'm trying to see if the boot print…

M1: It was number 12.

F1:	It's number 12. It's probably the same one. 

M1:	Ah, there is…

F1:	Yeah, he drew the boot print. I was just wondering if there was like a second person's boot print that he drew, but I don't think it matches any of the other ones, it matches 12 the best. Like, not exactly, but it's…

M1:	Not exactly, but yeah, from the others.

F1:	Yeah, okay.

M1:	Yeah, it looks like…okay, so I am going to read this, because I have not read it yet.

F1:	Okay. Why isn't his other shoe picture…

F2:	I know, I think there is, like, more footprints in the thing.

F1:	Okay. Yeah, you can't…so, let's see.

F2 [00:03:05]:	Yeah, but you can't really see what the tread is.
Part 21
F1 [2023/05/12 19:03:20 GMT+0000] :	Like, we're definitely missing something, but also, I feel like it is pointing to him.

F2:	Yeah. I feel like it's pointing to him, but it's like maybe too obviously pointing to him.

F1:	Uh-huh, yeah.

F2:	Because, like, if we're also considering Cherie, she did go and then turn on the music, and like, it's a bit strange.

F1:	Yeah, so, especially if, so…

F2:	Can you pass the other thing there, 'till I see what it is.

F1:	Yeah, so the Websters, since 2004…

F2:	Since 2004, okay.

F1:	…so, yeah, maybe it's…

F2:	Yeah, tried all of the months with five, and with…

F1:	So, try them with four, so it's probably his wedding anniversary month.

F2:	Uh-huh.

F1:	There's a lot of months. We don't know, there's no…

M1:	Where is…could you open it?

F2:	No.

M1:	Ah, okay. Where is the note about picking up the gift for his wife.

F1:	Ah, try, yeah, try 104, maybe that was their wedding anniversary. Darling's gift, maybe it's a present for his wife.

M1:	And this is the present?

F1:	No, I think this is like some souvenir of their wedding, or their anniversary.

M1:	Ah, is this her name, Webster?

F1:	Yeah, so it says 2004, so the year is probably four.

F2 [00:01:30]:	Yeah, I still can't get that.

F1 :	Aagh.Part 25:

F1 [2023/05/12 19:08:50 GMT+0000]:	Now, okay, what about the W? I don't know, like I feel like we could say it, but also, it's like, there are loose ends.

F2:	Yeah. Yeah, also, that was on the 3rd of December, so I was looking to see…can I have those?

M1:	Yes.

F2:	That's got, like a footprint on it, as well.

F1:	Yeah, we looked, and it looks like that is Chris', it matches Chris' one. So, yeah, so he changed his will on the 3rd of December. He got the message where he realised…

F2:	Yeah, because that's where he says, they witnessed for him, and put them in the safe.

F1:	Okay, so maybe the code implies that he did find the letter.

F2:	Uh-huh.

F1:	The code repeats. Like, it's, yeah, I think it was Chris. 

F2 [00:01:10]:	Whenever we tried checking it, it's not like, like two different ones, is it, like split in half, or something?

F1:	Yeah, that's…

F2:	I'm just thinking, what can the code repeats mean, unless it just means that he's seen that there's, like, more letters. 

F1:	Unless it's like, could it be every second letter?

M1:	Is this a Y, what's that letter? Is it the same thing, it's a Y?

F1:	It looks a bit like a U, as well, though.

M1:	Yeah, but [inaudible], no?

F1:	I don't know, it could be a bad U, because there's no examples of a U.

M1:	Yeah.

F1:	But it could, it looks like a Y.

M1:	Yeah, because if you look at how, these, like…

F1:	Uh-huh, so what is this 407?

M1:	407, it's the number of the Webster house.

F1:	Okay, but why is it on the inside?

F2:	Where is this?

M1:	We don't know the message.

F2 [00:02:55]:	Oh.Part 29:

F1 [2023/05/12 19:23:07 GMT+0000]:	Like, we're not actually necessarily looking for a weapon, if he died from a fall.

F2:	Yeah. And like, you'd like to think they wouldn't say it was a fall if it was obviously, like, a wound from a weapon. It's like gunshot wounds, yes, it was definitely a fall.

F1:	But he just fell over, you know, straight onto the bullets. Okay. Yeah. So, yeah, I would say that she went to his house to cover for him to make it seem like they were both in.

F2:	Yeah. But he's the only that's…

F1:	But he wasn't actually there.

F2:	…probably not accounted for.

F1:	Yeah, which is why she had to let herself in, instead of, like, just ringing the doorbell or whatever.

F2:	Uh-huh.

F1:	Yeah. Can you see anything else?

M1:	No. I mean, it's interesting that here he's giving the, I mean, he knew was the culprit of this stuff. And in the last will, he's been giving part of the property to Donna, and to Joan.

F1:	Yeah.

M1:	So, that's probably…the only thing is that, we maybe are missing something, I don't know. Because she went to the house, but that was at 2.30, and the murdering was after 3.30, no? So, is there some…

F1:	We don't know that she stayed there.

M1:	Yeah, we are not sure that she stayed, yeah.

F2:	Yeah.

M1:	Uh-huh. 

F1:	Yeah, and this also…

M1:	And this is like newspaper paper, hey?

F1 [00:01:23]:	Uh-huh. Yeah, and this also, like, doubly confirms that the person at the ritual was Joan, because she did that weird thing with the dead fox, she was like, this is for Vinegar Tom, and her cat was called Vinegar Tom. Yeah. 
F1 [2023/05/17 15:00:00 GMT+0000]: No. I learned everything I know about bartending boss, Nick Webster. So – wait a minute – okay. So he is the victim. Nick Webster. Is there anything about him? He taught me how to pull a pint, he helped me rearrange…blah, blah, blah. He even helped me rearrange my work schedule so that I could be home more where my sister was sick last year. Nick was the best. Old Scratch Tavern isn't much to look at, but it's one of those places that feels like home. That was all Nick.

	Nick died in December, sudden, bizarre, official story was he was drunk and lost his footing, but too many strange things happened in the months leading up to his death. Nick had been seeing the devil. Okay. For months he'd be telling anyone who'll listen there was someone or something lurking in the woods behind the bar.

M1:	So the…off the Old Scratch Tavern, the menu and such, the logo is also a devil.

F1:	Okay. Okay. At first everyone is thinking he's exaggerating. Nick could spend the whole night in a corner booth spinning yarns, there is no way he can make up this creepy blah, blah, blah, or dead animal…make up creepy notes he was getting, or dead animals on his doorstep. Where's that creepy note? What does it say?

M2:	Interlopers will be banished to the bottom of the Devil's Well.

M1:	So Devil's Well, Devil's Well. And there's something about Devil's Well on there as well. Yeah.

M2	[00:09:15]: Devil's well.F1 [2023/05/17 15:09:16 GMT+0000]: Okay. Dead animals on his doorstep, fires that kept flaring up near the building. Someone was trying to scare him, maybe even to death. He was obsessed with figuring out who was to blame. In the bar's office for hours poring over security camera footage and scribbling notes. 

[00:00:26]: On the night he died, I'd just closed up when he came out of the office, said he'd finally figured it out. Before he could explain, he saw someone outside and ran off into the woods. Before he could blah. My back was to the door, I didn't see anyone. By the time I'd turned around both Nick and the devil were gone, and all that was left was a small fire burning outside. After I'd put it out, I waited for Nick, he didn't come back. 

[00:00:44]: After the death was ruled an accident, I went through and found all the notes he'd been keeping about the devil in a locked deposit bag I still haven't figured out how to open. I even found proof that the devil was real finally caught on camera, like Nick had been trying to do for months. 

[00:01:00]: I took the evidence to the sheriff, he didn't care that Nick was chasing after someone that night.
M1	[2023/05/17 16:29:03 GMT+0000]: There are a few clues that we haven't used. Which frustrates me. 

F1:	Which ones?

M1:	Well, to begin with…

M2:	Most of them.

F1:	The most important ones?

M1:	This phone number on here, we haven't used. We haven't used the thing on the letter that was recovered from somewhere, that's addressed to Sherry Webster, but at the wrong address.

F1:	Oh. 

M1:	And we haven't used…we haven't really used this thing. 

M2:	The 2004 I used to get 
[00:00:44]: [the company?].

M1:	Yeah, but it's somewhere else as well. So somewhere else it says that it's their anniversary on a particular date. 

M2:	I think it doesn't mention the year though. 

M1:	Ah, okay. All right. [1:30:00] And we haven't used the other… Ah, this one.

M2:	Yeah. We have 
[00:01:04]: [voices overlap]…

F1:	I'm not good at things like the codes.

M2:	…the code-breaking stuff.

M1:	And…

F1:	So you two should be good at that, but…

M1:	Oh, well, so if that one… Oh. Right. Let me try this again.

F1:	Okay. 

M1:	So I've been doing the wrong one with the wrong one. So…

M2:	You got this, Jackie.

M1:	…one, two, three, four.

F1:	We're literally cleaning up around him.

M1:	Four…

F2:	Escaping.

M1:	…C…

F1:	I'm just going to, not tidy up, but go through finally everything.

M1	[00:01:47]: [Oh, this can't be done?]. One, two, three, four. Then the C becomes something that's also wrong. Ridiculous. Is it? 
[00:02:12]: [Inaudible]. What? 
[00:02:31]: [Inaudible]
Part 3:

F1 [2023/05/17 15:10:25 GMT+0000]: The official dissemination is Nick slipped and fell off a cliff. Thing is I went out to the place where he died and I don't think the authorities even bothered to look any further. There was caution tape down on the rocks but nothing at the top of the cliff. The ground near the ledge didn't look like it had been disturbed since Saturday night, and if the authorities had been there's no way they could count out foul play.

 Someone in a devil mask was there that night. There's somebody in that CCTV, isn't there?

M1: Yes. 

F1: And whoever it was pushed Nick off that cliff. The sheriff may not believe me but I must be making someone nervous, I've started to get threatening letters just like the ones Nick got before he died. I'd be lying if I said I'm not scared, I know I'm close I still have questions. I'm sending you all the evidence.

 Right. So Nick's the victim. 

M1: This is printed on Old Scratch Tavern…

M2: Mmm.

M1: …paper as well. So those three numbers are…

F1: Oh, sorry.

M1 [00:00:58]: …undoubtedly the……F1	[2023/05/17 15:11:27 GMT+0000]: Mmm.

M1:	Those. So this is…I mean, that's got to be the code for…

F1:	Oh, okay. Oh, yeah. Month, month, year.

M1:	Quite sure.

F1:	Right. Okay. 

M1:	The question is, the date you can't forget. Don't know. Marriage? Something like that?
F1:	Okay. 

M1:	It would be strange that a year has one digit. That's very strange. 

F1:	Okay. Shall I just skim this and see if there's anything in it, instead of keep reading everything out?

M1:	Sure. Yeah. 

F1:	It's up to you. What do you think?

M2:	What's on the back?

F1:	So they're…yeah, you kind of say that's the article, but this is…

M1:	Ah, okay.

F1:	…new developments for the Devil's Well. Okay. So quickly…

M1:	So it's all related to the Devil's Well thing. You had the files, I think, about the suspects? Or not?

M2:	Yeah.

M1:	So just to see what we've got, maybe.

F1:	Okay. 

M1:	So we've got newspaper article about the accident, but also about the well development.

M2:	Mmm.

M1:	We've got a poster related…so there are lots of things related to that Devil's Well development. So there is protection of the Devil's Well. Then we have the files there with the suspects, I guess.

M2	[00:01:21]: I assume.
Part 5:

M2	[2023/05/17 15:12:49 GMT+0000]: Yeah. It said there were four suspects, and [this fourth is not here?] 

	[00:00:05]:so I'm missing…

F1:	Oh, okay. That's the suspects.

M1:	Okay.

F1:	Who's a suspect? What have you got?

M2:	Donna Goddard.

F1:	Donna Goddard.

M2:	Joan Campbell.

F1:	Yeah. 

M2:	Chris Thompson. And Cherry Webber, Webster.

F1:	So do we need to establish their…? Sorry, Sherry Webber.

M2	[00:00:33]: [Inaudible]

F1:	Okay. 

M2:	And…hmm, Webster. Yeah.

F1:	Webster.

M2:	Since 2004.

F2	[00:00:46]: [Inaudible]

M2:	Sorry, breaking the fourth wall.

F1:	Right. I'm going to read through this article and see if there's anything about that's relevant.

M2:	Yeah. Sure. 

M1:	I'll transcribe this message that's on here. And then we can crack that.

M2:	Hmm. So one year, one-digit year, could be 2004. Do you think it might be when they got married?

M1:	Why is that one-digit year, 2004?

M2:	Well, it's just it's unlikely to be 1982, say, because that's a more ambiguous one-digit year.

M1:	Ah, so four as the…

M2:	So four would be the…

M1:	Yeah. Okay. Okay. So we need the date when they got married then maybe like the…

M2	[00:01:42]: [Only year], I guess.Part 7:

F1	[2023/05/17 15:16:04 GMT+0000]: Okay. So literally not a lot from this article about his death, other than the sheriff's office are just basically not interested, and it was they're ruling it an accident. They spoke to Sheriff Webster, his wife, who said, I have faith in the sheriff's office. So that's dodgy. If everyone else thinks he's been killed. M2:	Mmm. M1:	Mmm. F1:	He was the love of my life. Erm, and so…in July he'd reported burglaries, and a series of fires, and then he called the police ten times between the 1st of September and the 7th of December. When did he die? Where's the police report? Have we got one? Oh, well… 
M1:	Yeah. We should…maybe we should indeed just start gathering some… M2:	In some kind of systematic way.

M1:	…some facts about the case. F1:	Oh, he died on the 7th of December. M1:	And he made complaints until then? F1:	He made ten complaints to the sheriff's office between the 1st of September and the 7th of December. 
M1:	Okay. And he died on the 7th. F1:	So he died on the 7th. M1:	So there was a… F1:	So there was a lot of incidents leading up to that. M1:	An extramarital…

F1:	Okay…

M1	[00:02:06]: …extramarital relationship?Part 8:

R	[2023/05/17 15:18:13 GMT+0000]: So this is quickly the sheriff's office report. Coroner arrived, agreed the fall is likely the cause of death, said he's probably been dead three, four hours. Went to…who? To talk to a neighbour who found the body, stated he was out for a walk shortly after 
[00:00:14]: [06:00?] he discovered the body on the rocks, decided 
[00:00:18]: to call the police. Back to the scene, searched […] they haven't found anything so far. Empty beer bottles and litter, given update to McGinty. He says it's an accident. Coroner okay removal of remains. Told Sherry. She took it about as expected. Did my best to calm her down. Reassured her foul play unlikely, made sure she called her mother to come down and stay so she's not alone [15:18:56]: the time. Traffic stopped red Honda. What? Oh, for God's sake, I've read it the wrong way round.

	Right. Sherriff's report 1:34am. Traffic stopped red Honda going 60 miles an hour in a 25 zone, 
[00:01:12]: [Ames?] Avenue by Brewer Hill cemetery. Gave them a ticket. Okay. [15:19:35]: [Seventh?] of December. Red Honda. What's the bloody 
[00:01:26]: [name?]? Report of suspicious person.

M1:	Of the…

F1:	Thirteen CR66. What does that mean?

M2:	Was it an 
[00:01:37]: [apostrophe?]?

M3:	Yeah 
[00:01:38]: [inaudible]
Part 12:

M1	[2023/05/17 15:24:42 GMT+0000]: No, no, no.

F1:	No, no, he died before that, maybe.

M1:	So it was…when is the coroner report?

F1:	The coroner arrives then.

M1:	So then we know…it's 7:29…

F1:	Yeah.

M1:	…so say 7:30, minus…

F1:	That's when it was found.

M1:	Yeah. Yeah. But here the coroner says…so he was…he died three to four hours before half seven.

F1:	Okay. 

M1:	So what's that? That's between…

F1:	Half three.

M1:	…half three and half four.

F1:	Okay. Ah, yeah. Sorry. Sorry, that's when he was found. And she's stopped at 3:31.

M1:	Okay. Quite dark.

F1:	Yeah. 

M1:	I think we need to get a good overview of who the involved people are, and what the timeline is.

M2:	Mmm.

M1:	So you're working on timeline now.

F1:	Okay. I need to do 
[00:01:10]: [voices overlap]…

M1:	And I think you're also doing people.

F1:	Yeah.

M1:	And you are…so you have that already, almost.

M2:	Yeah. 

F1:	Can you quickly leaf through that one?

M2:	Decidedly underwhelmed by what I've…

M1:	Oh, yeah?

M2	[00:01:22]: [voices overlap].

F1:	So this is more about Devil's Well. Silver Lincoln. Who's got a red Honda? Oh, Chris Thompson is the police officer. And the police are like, it was an accident.

M1	[00:01:42]: Yes.
Part 16:

F1	[2023/05/17 15:31:34 GMT+0000]: …sixth of December, he was found, and he'd been dead for four hours. So he died around 3:30. Yeah? On the 7th of December, which is here. Seventh of December…

M1:	Seven December.

F1:	…three-thirty. 

M1:	Yeah. So that's…

F1:	Sorry…

M1:	…in the morning. Right? So that's at night.

F1:	Yeah. 

M1:	Yeah. Okay. 

F1:	Oh 7:29.

M1:	So it's am. Yeah. 

F1:	Coroner arrived. And this is the 7th.

M1:	Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

F1:	Okay. So on the 6th she leaves him a note. We've got her to… What day is this?

M1:	So the Saturday…the 7th is a Saturday.

F1:	It's a Saturday the 7th. Is it?

M2:	Sorry. Yeah. 

F1:	So we need to talk next Wednesday. 

M1:	Which then would be…

F1:	Well, it's irrelevant, isn't it?

M1:	…the 11th.

M2:	The 11th. Yeah. 

F1:	She was on edge. This is the 6th, 6th of December. D-G. What is it?

M1:	We're going at this so chaotically. 

F1:	I know.

M2:	Yes. 

M1:	Oh, God. 

M2:	What do you reckon?

F1:	I think Donna did it, but 
[00:01:04]: [inaudible] Last person to leave the bar. At the funeral reception, we talked. It was like a second home to her. 
[00:01:12]: [Inaudible]. However, everyone there could see what a special [15:32:50]: [place that they've made?]. Looked like she'd been crying 
[00:01:18]: [a lot?]. We talked afterwards. If only I'd been faster maybe I could have saved him. Right. Wait.
Part 18:

F1	[2023/05/17 15:34:11 GMT+0000]: Okay. This is the notes also that he's taken, up to December. This is from the notes that he said all the things that have happened. Rock through the window…

M2:	Mmm.

F1:	See if there's anything from that. 

M1:	Okay. I'm halfway through this one.

M2:	What kind of [00:00:16]: [thing are we?] looking for?

F1:	Oh, sorry. I think this is a list of the incidents that have happened between…well, I think it's supposed to be July is when it started. But…

M2:	So this is from October to December the 7th.

F1:	Right. Okay. So he had called the police. He called the police ten times between the 1st of September and the 7th of December.

M2:	Mmm.

F1:	So I'll see what's in there. Oh, good. Right. God. Joan Campbell. 

M1:	Oh, I'm also reading about John Campbell.

F1:	Joan.

M1:	Mmm. 

F1:	Yeah. She's saying he got what he deserved. Apparently he'd been claiming some evil corporation from Indianapolis wants to sow the land near Devil's Well with poison; sound's pretty out there.

M2:	Mmm.

F1:	Nothing. 

M2:	There's a drawing of a footprint on…

M1:	Mmm. 

M2:	…these things, which I guess we can maybe figure out.

F1:	Could we compare it to the photos of the…

M2:	Do we know what these are of?

F1:	I don't know. Has he taken those, maybe?

M2	[00:01:50]: Maybe.
Part 9: F1	[2023/05/17 15:19:53 GMT+0000]: No sign of unusual activity on arrival. Searched property. Called in all clear. Traffic stop 
[00:00:07] silver Lincoln, tail lights out. CR66. Warning. Collision between blue 
[00:00:14]: [car that?] …oh, that's all right. Okay. This is leading up to it. Possible dead body call in Devil's Well, confirmed no signs of life. Called coroner. Made initial search of area, no signs of struggle. Okay. So these are the things that happened before it. 
M2:	Mmm. 
F1:	A suspicious traffic stop for a red Honda going 60 miles an hour, that's on the night of the death. That's at 1:34 and the body's found at 6am by… Where was the body found? Do we know? Oh…wait a minute. M1:	That was…you just read that out. F1:	Yeah. Possible dead body in Devil's Well.M1:	Yeah. F1:	Right. Okay. But that's Brewer Hill cemetery the ticket's issued. So…that's Brewer's Hill. How far is that from…? Can we establish how far that is? Brewer's Hill to Devil's Well? Where is Devil's Well? Ah. M1:	Not on there. F1:	Not there. Wait. Did he support Devil's Well? What was his connection with it? M1:	Who is he again? F1:	Nicholas Webster. He's the victim.

M1	[00:01:17]: Yes. Nicolas Webster. I don't see him…not on here. Oh, this is the…this I think, is this their…Part 11:

M1	[2023/05/17 15:23:33 GMT+0000]: That they thought he'd been dead for three hours by then.

F1:	Oh. 

M1:	Right?

F1:	Did I?

M1:	I say…I think you…

F1:	Oh, yeah, the Coroner said that. Coroner. Coroner, where is he? Blah, blah, blah, possible dead. Oh, Coroner. Where is that?

M1:	Was it in there? No? Wasn't it?

F1:	Oh, yeah. Here it is. Coroner arrived, agreed fall is likely cause of death, says he's probably been dead three to four hours.

M1:	Ah, no. Dead three to four hours at 7:30, say?

F1:	Yeah, but that's when he arrived.

M1:	Yeah? 

F1:	So that's when the call came in.

M1:	So seven…7:30…

F1	[00:00:36]:…[voices overlap] …

M1:	Yeah, but if the coroner then said he'd been dead three to four hours at…

F1:	Seven-thirty. That's still possible.

M1:	Seven…7:30. Minus, say…

F1:	Four hours.

M1:	Four hours.

R:	Three-thirty-one.

M1:	So that that's still a possibility. It doesn't rule out anything in that case. Yeah.

F1:	No. But she is…

M1:	Should we make an ACH matrix?

F1:	She is…

M1:	We should.

M2	[00:00:59]: [Inaudible].

M1	[00:00:59]: [We should?].

F1:	Okay. Nick Webster died at 6:37. Oh, okay. Between 6:37 and 7:30. Yeah?

M1:	Yeah. 

F1:	And she was stopped at 3:31. So she…

M1:	No, so he didn't die between then and then.

F1	[00:01:07]: He did.
Part 13:

F1	[2023/05/17 15:26:25 GMT+0000]: Okay. So he's…that's a stroke against him.

M1:	Is he having an affair with 
[00:00:19]: [voices overlap]?

F1:	Yeah. Oh, my God, this so exciting.

M1:	Okay. 

F1:	Isn't it, John?

M2:	I'm loving every second of it so far.

M1:	John's done some incredible work.

F1:	Okay. 

M1:	No, no. So it's… So this…

M2:	No, it's not… No, it's not that one.

F1:	Oh, he has done some incredible work. 

M1:	Oh, it's not that one.

M2:	This is… This is the stuff 
[00:00:48]: [voices overlap]…

M1:	Oh, okay. Well, that's less exciting indeed. Sorry, I thought it was that one already.

M2:	But that one's next.

M1:	All right. So the text as in…is that's the text, just transcribed.

F1: 

[00:00:58]: No sign of [voices overlap] collision between a blue Cadillac and a black Lincoln, and a Volkswagen 

[00:01:08]: [Toyota Prius?]. Right, the cars…this is a dead end with the cars. Well, apart from…

M2:	No. 

F1:	John, have you read those statements?

M2:	I skimmed them. I've not read them. Okay? But you might want to read them.

F1:	Okay. Now that we've got more 
[00:01:29]: [voices overlap].

M2:	Now. Now that someone 
[00:01:30]: [voices overlap].

M1:	The thing is, with these things there's never anything coincidence. Right? So the distance between this and that, 
[00:01:35]: [it has a roll on one side?]. It's not a coincidence.

M2	[00:01:38]: No. 
Part 14:

M1	[2023/05/17 15:28:04 GMT+0000]: I realise it's not an escape room, but still.

F1:	Okay. Donna Goddard…

M2:	That would be easy. Is this double D?

M1:	Yes. Sorry. Yes. 

F1	[00:00:13]: [Inaudible]. She was the last person to leave the bar the night Nick died. She seemed on edge, but when I asked her if everything was okay she shrugged it off, left a note on her menu and a matchbox on the counter for Nick. But he never got a chance to see it. 

	Right. This is back to Donna Goddard again. So she's the one that gets the ticket with the car.

M2:	Mmm.

F1:	With the car. And these are… Is this the information from Carmen?

M1:	This is what we got from our colleague 
[00:00:54]: [voices overlap] person.

F1:	Oh, yeah. Right. Okay. Okay. Yeah, this is Carmen's notes, I think.

M1:	So the matchbox we've got, with…

F1:	Right. She handled the sale of the bar when Nick bought it in 2005. His father opened 
[00:01:11]: [it in '57?], very involved around time, last person to leave the bar, left an hour before closing, she…late for her, seemed on edge, but when I asked if everything was okay she shrugged it off, she'd left a note on her menu, and a matchbox on the counter for Nick. Right. 
[00:01:29]: We need to talk.
Part 15:

M1	[2023/05/17 15:29:37 GMT+0000]: Need to talk, with…about…

F1:	On when…about 
[00:00:03]: [voices overlap]

M1:	So we need to talk about Wednesday and 
[00:00:23]: Devil's Well.

M2:	Mmm. 

M1:	So I don't know what's happening on Wednesday.

F1:	Wednesday at 11pm.

M1:	Yes. 

F1:	Wednesday at… Right, the timeline, that's important.

M1:	Yeah, but I don't know… What's the… Oh, about land.

F1:	About land.

M1:	Devil's Well. Wednesday…

F1:	Wednesday, 11pm.

M1:	Yes. 

F1:	Right. Okay. So wait, when is that?

M1:	Yeah.

F1:	Is that then…? That's the night he died. Yeah. 

M1:	The night he died is when…

F1:	She… It says here, last person to leave the bar the night Nick died.

M1:	Yes.

F1:	So 7th of December is when he died. Right? In the early hours.

M1:	Think so.

F1:	Yeah. 

M1	[00:01:08]: [Voices overlap]

F1:	So we're saying that at 3:31, 3:31 roughly, he died.

M1:	So that's a Saturday. Yeah?

F1:	Yeah. And then…

M1:	That's a Saturday.

F1:	Yeah. So an hour before… Last person to leave the bar the night Nick died. So this would be six, the 6th of December. Yeah?

M1:	Well…

F1:	Well, the bar's got to close at… No, I don't know now.

M1:	No, I think… So wouldn't that be…would that be am or pm?

F1:	This is pm, the night he died on the 6th…

M1	[00:01:53]: The night he died. Yeah. 
Part 17:

F1	[2023/05/17 15:32:59 GMT+0000]: She said something really odd – this is Donna – at the funeral. 

	At the funeral reception, blah, blah, blah, she was crying a lot. We talked afterwards. And then she said something really odd, if only I'd been faster maybe I could have made a difference. Before I can ask her what she meant Nolan came over and she started telling him about a job offering, blah, blah. Was grateful for 
[00:00:23]: [inaudible] we've been struggling. Went over to the house, hoping I could talk to her about Nick. She said she'd been having a rough night, was preoccupied. Then I decided to go for a drive, try to clear my thoughts, but only got worse from there. When I asked about the stuff she'd left at the bar, she got really anxious and said we shouldn't talk here, and hustled me out of the house. Tried to call her, no answer. Called her office, and said she'd left on a business trip, not sure when she's supposed to get back.

	Is she…? Are there any statements to the police? No? Have they not taken any?
M1:	Is she dead too?

M2:	The police are bloody useless.

F1:	Yeah, they really are.

M1:	Is this just yours?

M2:	Yeah. 

M1	[00:01:11]: Oh, okay. Part 23:

F1	[2023/05/17 15:41:43 GMT+0000]: Means, we don't know. Opportunity, at 3am, when he was… Yeah. So this is a…she got there at, like, three in the morning, and she spent 30 to 40 minutes with this woman burning herbs and chanting. And then she made her pick up a fox. Well, it's got to be her. 
 M1:	Why? 
 M2	[00:00:25]: [Bees?]. 
 F1:	Joan Campbell. She's eccentric, to put it mildly. She'll sit in a chair by the roadside, curse people driving by. She's claiming someone from an evil corporation wants to sow the land near the Devil's Well with poison or something. She said Nick has got what he deserved. 
 M1:	So she's motivated, but you think that she is the 
[00:00:48]: [voices overlap]… 
 F1:	I think she's been doing that. Yeah. 
 M1:	Okay. 
 F1:	Yeah?
M2:	Yeah. Yeah. 
 M1:	All right. 
 F1:	How…? Are we getting any…? Can you see anything from her face? 
 M1:	At times, yes, but… 
 F1:	Right. 
 M2:	Derision. 
 F2:	Enjoyment 
[00:01:00]: [of this combination?]. Right. 
 F1:	I think we rule her out. 
 M1:	Oh. So…interestingly enough… 
 F1:	Uh-huh. 
 M1:	…Joan Campbell… 
 F1:	Yeah. 
 M1:	…is one of the beneficiaries of Nick Webster's testament. 
 F1:	Oh, well, that's motive. 
 M1:	So Nick Webster is leaving 5,000 to the Save Devil's Well Foundation. 
 F1:	So he's in support of it? 
 M1	[00:01:10]]: Now I'm utterly confused.Part 19:

M1	[2023/05/17 15:36:02 GMT+0000]: So here it says that Joan Campbell is the only member of the Save Devil's Well Foundation, and she threatened councillors at a council meeting about it. And the council says they won't say what the land is going to be used for once it's sold, but it will greatly enrich the town. There was an altercation at the council meeting. 
 F1:	And Joan has been arrested for assault and trespass, in '97 and 2001. The charges were dropped. 
 M2:	I have no idea what this means, but that… 
 M1:	That shoe is that shoe. 
 M2:	…that shoe is that shoe, which I think is also that shoe. Yeah. 
 F1:	Okay.
 M1:	What else does it say in the…in…sorry, on… 
 F1:	And… 
 M1:	…this one? 
 F1:	…in this… 
 M1:	So it's a man's shoe. Okay. 
 F1:	In this report on Joan it says she snuck – this is Carmen, I think – snuck into her property when I knew she'd be in town. Well, should be out of town. Took a picture of something that looks promising, but still waiting on results from deviant tracker boot tread database. Did you get it? 
[00:01:13]: Has he solved it?Part 20:

M2	[2023/05/17 15:37:17 GMT+0000]: Well, I don't know what the fuck's in it, probably more crap to read.

F1:	Now I wish I could afford the full version, because light isn't impressing me. So she's found a boot in Joan's place.

M2:	Ah.

F1:	Right. Let me just read this again quickly. Snuck into her…onto her property when I knew she'd been in town – oh, she'd be in town, so it was on her property – took a picture of something that looks promising but I'm still waiting on the results from deviant tracker…from the deviant tracker boot tread database.

M2:	Ha. Well, it's 
[00:00:54]: [voices overlap].

F1:	Wish I could afford the pro version because light isn't impressing me. We are missing something 
[00:01:04]: [voices overlap].

M2:	I don't know. 

M1:	What do you mean, you don't know? Oh, I thought 
[00:01:10]: [we had a key?]. No. Not yet. Right?

F1:	Okay. This is like a good…good fences, like…what do you call them, when people talk amongst themselves on a forum. Hey, I know it's last minute, but is anyone going to this burnishing ceremony out by Devil's Well tonight? This is on the 6th of December at 7:23.

M2:	Mmm.

F1:		I've seen flyers for it around town and it sounds cool, but also I don't want to get murdered, or whatever. Anyone know who's organising it? No idea who's running it. 
[00:01:47]: All right.Part 24:

F1	[2023/05/17 15:42:56 GMT+0000]: Okay. Here's another one on the 7th at 6:32, 7th of December. If you live on Carmichael Road, good luck if you want to sleep through the night; I didn't get a wink because of my inconsiderate hussy of a…because my neighbour's inconsiderate hussy of a girlfriend shows up at his house at all hours to be as disruptive as possible. I swear she knocked over every single thing in the back yard. I don't know what possessed her to start playing music so late but I assume she intended to annoy him. Thankfully it stopped after a couple of hours. What time was that? 
[00:02:34]: [Well, it doesn't say?]. But not before she robbed me of my sleep. It isn't the first time they've been inappropriately loud. Oh, so that's… Ah.

	Okay. So who is the…? If we could find out who this is, this could rule out…

M1	[00:02:50]: [Her?]?

F1:	…because she turned up at my neighbour's inconsid-…my neighbour's inconsistent hussy of a girlfriend. So she was there from 2:30am for a couple of hours.

M1:	Mmm.

F1:	No. Wait a minute. 
[00:03:14]: [Yeah?]. Thankfully it stopped after a couple of hours. And somebody said, well, that was at 2:30 last night.

M2:	Yeah.

F1:	Okay. Who is this then?

M1:	So that's the…

F1:	Could this be…? No, Sherry's his wife. 

M1:	Where's the 
[00:03:34]: [menu]?

F1:	Who's Donna? Ah, no, this is somebody else that we could rule out. 
[00:03:39]: So it's another woman we could rule out.
Part 22:

M1	[2023/05/17 15:40:30 GMT+0000]: So would that mean that the person who that is?

F1:	Oh, she's got an alibi.

M1:	Yeah. 

F1:	Yeah?

M1:	Mmm. Well, unless she's lying. 

F1:	But this is somebody who didn't know her.

M1:	Ah, right. Yes. 

F1:	Yeah?

M1:	Yes. Yes. Yes.

F1:	So… Okay, then the next person's…

M2	[15:40:46]: [Voices overlap] witch. Do we want to keep track of means, motive and opportunity for each of the four 
[15:40:53]: [voices overlap]?

M1:	Yeah, we should. 

M2:	Considering that was the instruction we were given right at the start.

F1:	Right. Okay. So hold on, we've got 
[00:00:16]: [voices overlap]…

M2:	That's my 
[00:00:23]: [voices overlap]. 

F1:	So…shit, where's the third…? Joan Campbell. Joan, I think, has got an alibi. I think we rule her out. Do we not?

M1:	So she's got…

F1:	She's definitely got a motive.

M1:	Yeah. So the motive of Joan is that she is against development of Devil's Well, whereas apparently the murdered guy…was in favour?

F1:	I don't even know.

M1:	Who was the murdered guy again?

F1:	He 
[00:01:00]: [ran the bar?].

M1:	Nick Webb, is that?

F1:	Nick Webster.

M1:	Nick Webster. Okay. 

F1:	Sherry's husband. So she's got motive. What's the other thing?

M2:	Means, motive and opportunity.

F1:	Means. Well, a…

M1	[00:01:10]: So means, we don't know yet.Part 27:

F1	[2023/05/17 15:48:01 GMT+0000]: So he's taken that from…

M1:	That was addressed to Chris Thompson.

F1:	Oh. Oh, she's taken that from him. Sorry. 

M1:	Don't know who Christ Thompson is.

F1:	That's this…

M1:	Ah, that's Chris Thompson. Okay. Yes. Right.

F1:	I think that we should have read these in detail. What does that other envelope say?

M1:	So the other envelope was in the secure bag.

F1:	Sherry Webster.

M1:	It's to Sherry Webster. But all of this is about the Webster 
[00:01:32]: [estate?].

F1:	Ah. Ah. Ah. Wait a minute. So I've got a bit of it now. So Chris Thompson lives on Carmichael Road.

M2:	Mmm.

M1:	Yes. 

F1:	The argument with his girlfriend… Right, this is going to rule people out here I think. So Christ Thompson lives on Carmichael Road, at…on the 7th of December early in the morning, on Carmichael Road, the woman who is [15:50:00] I think, his girlfriend, Sherry, is the wife of the deceased.

M1:	Mmm.

F1:	She's the girlfriend that shows up at his house at all hours. And somebody else said, oh, that was what all the noise was at 2:30 last night. She was there for two hours.

M1:	So…

F1:	She she's out.

M1:	So Sherry…

M2:	Sherry's out.

M1:	…that…that…

F1:	Sherry's out.

M1:	That the wife of the deceased…

F1:	Yeah.

M1:	…had an extramarital affair with…

F1:	With him.

M1:	…the policeman. 

F1	[00:02:32]: Yeah.Part 29:

M1	[2023/05/17 15:51:37 GMT+0000]: Yeah, but she wasn't one of the suspects, is she?

F1:	She is a suspect. 

M1:	Oh, she is?

F1:	Yeah, she was a suspect. 

M1:	Ah, okay. Okay. Okay.

F1:	I'll bet you get extra points for this, because I'm making the most progress.

M1:	On fire. 

M2:	Well, that's one point. 

F1:	Right. Okay. Let's just read…oh, la, la, la, right, okay. He was a lady's man. He's saying it was…Nick's death was an accident. Talked about his hobbies. This is Carmen going over to see him. She said he's been helping Sherry with stuff around the house, just trying to be a friend in need. On my way out I took a peek into his car, noticed something, might be useful. Ran into him at 
[00:00:48]: [Limestone Diner?], gave me a bunch of platitudes about moving on with your life, as if he has any idea what I'm going through. After he was done condescending me, he went to pay his bill and left his pocket notebook sitting on the table. Couldn't resist tearing a page out, too bad I didn't get more. 

	Showed up at my house later that night, scared me half to death banging on the door, accused me of theft, threatened to press charges. I know he won't. If he can even figure out that Nick was murdered there's no way that he'll be able to prove anything. 

	Is there anything ripped out, like a page…?

M1:	There's those yellow pages from the…

F1	[00:01:08]: Oh, no, is that not…?
Part 25:

M1	[2023/05/17 15:45:25 GMT+0000]: Oh.

M2:	So there's only two women. Right?

F1:	Yeah. No, there's three women. Sherry Webster, the wife. 

M1:	Joan Campbell, the…

F1:	Joan Campbell, the nutter. Or you are not allowed to say that. Joan Campbell, she's got issues. Donna Goddard. This is getting too 
[00:00:27]: [inaudible]. Donna Goddard. Donna Goddard, what 
[00:00:38]: [did she?]…?

M1:	Who is Donna Goddard again? I don't remember.

F1:	She's her.

M1:	Oh, yeah.

F1:	And we think she's got an alibi. Why? Why did we say she's…? Oh, she got a… No, no, she's not got an alibi. She has got a ticket at 3:31 in the morning.

M1:	Ah, yeah. Yeah.

F1:	So she's a big suspect, this one. And…talked to her about the night, that said she'd been having a rough time that night, was preoccupied. Then she said she'd decided to go for a drive and clear her thoughts, but only got worse from there. And then she said, oh, we shouldn't talk here. God.

M1:	Mmm. 

F1:	Right. Now we're onto the policeman. God, how long do normal people take to solve this? What did they say?

F2:	I'll tell you after. But, I mean, I wouldn't call those three particularly 
[00:01:32]: [normal?] either, so don't worry.

F1:	Do you think that we're doing really bad, or okay?

F2:	It's interesting. 
[00:01:39]: It's different.
Part 31:

F1	[2023/05/17 15:54:14 GMT+0000]: [It was me?]. So if I put a jagged line through there, of her. She's a bloody suspect, her. And her father was something. What was that? Check the dad. Joan Campbell, we think she might have an alibi, so I'm not going to rule her out completely. 

M2:	Here's something weird. I don't know if this actually means anything at all…

M1:	Oh, is this ripped out of a…?

F1:	Well, that's a police report.

M2:	This is…police report. These…

F1:	Mmm.

M2:	…that are written…like a psychopath. The same as on the 
[00:00:41]: [voices overlap] there.

M1:	Yes.

F1:	Oh. Oh, and…

M1:	That's true. 

F1:	Where else does it say the CR66. Oh, no, 
[00:00:49]: [that's 66?]. Okay. 

M2:	And on the envelope here.

M1:	Okay. Yes. 

M2:	So that's a piece of information
[00:00:58]: [you found?]. 

M1:	Fair enough.

F1:	What's it 
[00:01:02]: [inaudible]?

M1:	That was in the secure deposit box, that is correspondence email between the Websters. Interestingly enough, Mrs Webster, with the company that wants to redevelop Devil's Well.

F1:	Mmm. 

M1:	And they wanted to sell, and then in the end it doesn't happen. So…

F1:	Oh, it's Mrs Webster wants to…? Oh, no, no, no. 

M1:	Mmm. Not sure.

F1:	Right. Okay. Okay. I understand you're a busy man, 
[00:01:46]: [it's that I am due that?] from your wife about that offer. I thought I'd 
[00:01:51]: [write?] to you instead. I can assure 
[00:01:53]: [inaudible]. So she has bloody got… Oh, God. I'm so confused.Part 30:

M1	[2023/05/17 15:52:48 GMT+0000]: That's the only two, I think, that are ripped-out pages, that I saw. 
 F1:	No, I think they're from… No, that's from whatshisname. 
 M1:	Well, how do we know? 
 F1:	Because he's saying, rock comes through the back window. 
[00:00:28]: [Nothing on cans?]. Two fires in one night, fire department thinks I'm crazy. 
 M1:	Well, but this might be… So if he's been taking the calls from Nick. So he was the police officer answering the phone. So these might be his notes of the complaints that came in from the 
[00:00:44]: [voices overlap]… 
 M2:	No 
[00:00:44]: [voices overlap]… 
 F1:	No. 
 M2:	…he's definitely…
 F1:	That's the first person writing that. 
 M2:	First person. It's Nick's… 
 F1:	That's Nick's notes. 
 M1:	Okay. 
 M2:	He's also talking in there about his… 
 F1:	Look, I can see the devil in the woods, I'm… 
 M1:	Okay. Yeah. Okay. 
 F1:	…just not… Right. Okay… 
 M1:	Yeah. So this wouldn't be a transcript of…
F1:	No. 
 M1:	…of what the other guy is saying. No. 
 F1:	No. 
 M1:	Okay. 
 F1:	Okay. I think we can rule out Sherry Webster. I think she had a motive… 
 M1:	She had a motive. But…
 F1:	But… 
 M1:	Well, so there is more motive. 
 F1:	She had a motive, but she has an alibi. And that's what they said at the start, if people have alibi you can pretty much clear them. Somebody said. 
 M1	[00:01:22]: Er…yes.
Part 32:

M1 [2023/05/17 15:56:15 GMT+0000]: Oh. Sorry. A fairly random thing. Nick Webster knew that Sherry was having an affair.

M2: Yeah.

F1: Oh, okay. 

M2: Sorry, I thought you'd already read that. I could have 
[00:00:37]: [said that?].

M1: No 
[00:00:38]: [inaudible]. I skipped the omission bit, interestingly enough.

F1: I think… So this is basically saying that…

M2: And this seems to be something about…

M1: Yeah. 

F1: This, is this basically saying that Sherry's wanting to do a deal behind her husband's back for the land?

M1: It looks like it.

F1: Yeah.

M1: But then in the end I think it doesn't…doesn't happen, does it?

F1: No, because on November the 8th… Sorry. Here we go, on October the 25th Sherry is saying to the developer, I'm so glad we were able to come to agreement, Nick and I just need a few weeks to put our affairs in order and then we should be able to finalise the deal. Then he gets back to her and said…then he…he, the developer, gets back to her a couple of weeks later and says, I appreciate that big decisions like this one take time, I hope to hear from you soon what the hell's happening. And so there's no contact after that. Maybe Nick finds out that Sherry is…

M1: Yeah.

F1: …planning to that.

M1 [00:01:54]: Yeah.Part 28:

M1	[2023/05/17 15:50:34 GMT+0000]: And the policeman is now saying it was an accident.
 F1:	Yes, he's saying it was an accident. 
 M1:	Okay. 
 F1:	So… And then… So Sherry turns up at his house being loud and inappropriate, was going on for a couple of hours, and that started at 2:30. 
 M2:	So if he was there, is he ruled out as well? 
 F1:	He's not there. He…I don't think he was there. 
 M1:	He's not ruled out. He's not ruled out. 
 F1:	No. 
 M2:	Okay. 
 M1:	Ah, but maybe she's making all that noise because he wasn't there, or whatever. 
 F1:	Yeah. Well, let's just quickly read… If you… I didn't get…my neighbour's girlfriend, she was up at his house at all hours, I swear she knocked out every single thing in the back yard. Then she turns out the lights, which shine…turns on the lights, which shine into my bedroom. I don't know what possessed her, but I assume it was intended to annoy me. Thankfully it stopped after a couple of hours. This isn't the first time, you'd think they'd have some decency to be ashamed of themselves, but no, they are determined to make a mockery.

	Maybe he was there, it doesn't say he wasn't there. 
 M1:	Yeah, so we… 
 F1:	Maybe they're both ruled out. 
 M1:	…we can't rule it out either. Yeah. 
 F1:	No, no, we can rule… 
[00:00:56]: We can rule her out because she was there making a noise. Part 6: M1	[2023/05/17 15:14:33 GMT+0000]: That's also just assuming that the bag belonged to… M2:	It's just that that was the first… M1:	Yeah, perhaps 

[00:00:11]: the date… M2:	Yeah. M1:	…the year. Okay. There are certain things that are just very coincidental. M2:	Mmm. M1:	Like here for instance, that this is through the back of a…looking into a car. Right? So we can see the 

[00:00:42]: [voices overlap] … M2:	Yeah. Yeah. M1:	But then it just… M2:	It's a Toyota. M1:	A Toyota. And… M2:	Yeah. Yeah. M1:	…and that's not there by accident. M2:	It's not coincidence. Yeah. M1:	No. I'll write down this bit of text. M2:	Yeah. I also started doing the stuff on the back of here, which I'll maybe finish in the day, but…

M1:	Okay. Yeah. M2:	…didn't look wildly useful. M1:	Well, it'll be needed to prep this one. F1:	So Sherry is his wife. M2:	Yeah. F1:	Yeah. F2	[00:01:13]: [Inaudible]? You can open it completely, can you not? M1:	No, you cannot. M2:	That is now open completely. M1:	Yeah. You can't…no, you can't read it. F2:	Oh, right. Okay. M1:	Oh. That's easier. I would have been able to read it. Yeah. M2:	Oh, Christ. I've not read this much in years. F1:	I know. M2	[00:01:28]: It's like a fucking book.Part 36:

M2	[2023/05/17 16:01:42 GMT+0000]: So the ticket might be…

F1:	Yeah, that might be a fish. What do you call them?

M1:	Red herring. 

F1:	Yeah. 

M1:	It's a fish.

M2:	You're not wrong.

F1:	It's a fish.

M1:	Okay. I'm going to give this a stab. 

M2:	But I…

F1:	Yeah, because she says… Sorry. 

M2:	Some thoughts. None of them are good.

F1:	Sorry. Go on. 

M2:	Sorry, it's on this code stuff. So at the end of this thing, the code repeats, I know. So I think there's some shift for…

F1:	Oh, 
[00:01:05]: [voices overlap]… Can I say something?

M2:	Yeah.

F1:	Quickly. So Donna Goddard gets a ticket at 3:31, and when she's talking to, whatshername, Carmen, and she's crying a lot, and she said, if only I'd been faster maybe I could have made a difference. 

M1:	Right. So she's trying to save him.

F1:	That's why she got a ticket. She's trying to save him. So she…because…

M1:	Who…? What's the name on the ticket?

F1:	It's Donna Goddard, it's 
[00:01:34]: [voices overlap]…

M1:	Yeah, I know. Who's the attending officer?

M2:	So I think this is…

F1:	Oh, it's…

M2:	Chris Thompson.

F1:	Yeah, could be. I don't know.

M2:	Well, it's a C.

F1:	It's a signature. Have we got a signature of his on something else?

M1:	Mmm. This is 
[00:01:58]: [only Nicholas?]

F1:	Oh, right. Okay. So she's trying to save him. Donna. And she was really upset.

M1:	Mmm. 
[00:02:09]: [Voices overlap]
Part 35:

M1	[2023/05/17 16:00:36 GMT+0000]: That's a woman's shoe. That's one of the suspects live at something that ends in a number two for an address. So that's number…

F1:	That's four oh seven.

M1:	Four oh seven.

F1:	She's 
[00:00:27]: [inaudible] oh five. She's two County Road.

M1:	Yeah, so two County Road. So I think the implication here is that Joan only owns one pair of shoes that she ever uses.

F1:	Okay.

M1:	And so therefore it shouldn't be her.

F1:	Okay.

M1:	Maybe. Because these are not the right shoes. It's 
[00:00:45]: [voices overlap]…

F1:	And we think…and we think Joan was being crazy.

M1:	Against the government. And Nick was as well.

F1:	Yeah. And she was…

M1:	So they were on the same side. 

F1:	Yeah, they were on the same side. And she was out doing herbs and stuff with that Leah…

M1:	All right. 

F1:	…at the same time. So I think we definitely rule Joan out. Donna got a ticket at the time of death, though. 

M2:	Where was that?

M1:	But that's possible. Right? To get a ticket?

F1:	Yeah, that is possible, to get a ticket. So…

M2:	Do we have the exact time of death?

M1:	No, that…

F1:	Three to four hours before…

M1:	So half three to…

F1:	Seven, half seven. Three, four hours before.

M1	[00:01:06]: Yeah.
Part 21:

F1	[2023/05/17 15:39:05 GMT+0000]: Well, I'll read this to myself. Running out 
[00:00:01]: [inaudible] with a bunch of strangers. I can't make the ritual. So I end up going 
[00:00:09]: [and it's?] totally bonkers. I got there, like, at three in the morning. That he got murdered at half three. No. Yeah. Yeah, right. Listen.

	She's put something in on the 7th of December at 4:47am, this is after he's killed. This is Mia. So I wind up going myself and it was totally bonkers, I got there at, like, three in the morning, it was just me and this lady with a basket of weird herbs. She's got… She is a bee farmer that sells honey. 
[00:00:40]: [Yes?], I know it's not herbs, but…

M1	[00:00:42]: [It's close enough?].

F1:	We spent, like, 30 to 40 minutes burning herbs and chanting. At one point I heard something crashing around in the under-bush and I got worried she'd actually summoned something, but I guess it was just an animal. Then she hands me the shovel [0:40:00] and tells…shuffle, shovel…and tells me to start walking. I thought she was going to kill me, instead she made me pick up a dead fox off the side of the highway and carry it over to this old dive bar. She made me put the fox on the ground by the mailbox, and then she covered it with ashes 
[00:01:12]: [and yelled?] for Vinegar Tom, whatever that means. After that she thanked me for helping support the cause. Anyway, I guess perdition has its very own witch. 
[00:01:23]: Oh, that's boring.
Part 26:

M1	[2023/05/17 15:47:07 GMT+0000]: We're very chaotic.

F1:	Yeah, we're doing this chaotically, but it's our first time at this, so…

M1:	Old Scratch Tavern is on…is a country road…a county…county road, 66. So what was the other road you were just talking about? You mentioned…

F1:	Perdition. Perdition? No. Carmichael.

M1:	Carmichael. Okay. 

F1:	Carmichael Road.

M1:	Okay. 

F1:	Okay. This is the…now the police officer. He's one of the suspects.

M1:	Yes. 

F1:	So… Okay. He's very outdoorsy. Carmen went to talk to him at the sheriff's officer, on the Tuesday. Okay, that's before the death. Right. He confirmed… Oh, no, that's after the death.

M1:	Or after. Yeah. 

F1:	Sorry. He confirmed…

M1:	Which Tuesday is this? But yeah.

F1:	He confirmed Nick's blood alcohol level wasn't off the charts. He was tipsy but not seriously impaired. When she pressed him for more information he told me details aren't being made available to the public, said Nick's death was tragic but accidents just sometimes happen. Then Carmen goes to his home and he seemed annoyed but he let her in, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and… Oh, snooped around a bit while he was in the kitchen getting plates and stole an opened envelope, which was at the bottom of the pile of mail on the table. What's the envelope? I think that's that envelope.

M1:	So that will be that envelope. 
[00:00:53: Yeah. Part 37:

F1	[2023/05/17 16:04:00 GMT+0000]: She gets a ticket, but I think it's because of that. Are we agreed? Joan Campbell, we don't think it is. It's between Sherry Webster and Chris Thompson.

M1:	Yeah, but if it's Chris that wrote the ticket…

F1:	Mmm.

M1:	…then it's not Chris that pushed him off the cliff in the meantime.

M2:	How do we know?

F1:	How do we know that? Because he could have died between 3:30 and 4:30.

M1:	Yeah, but if Donna says, if only I got there earlier… Did Donna get there in the end?

F1:	No. 

M1:	Did she leave when she got the ticket?

F1:	Oh, who knows. Okay. If only I'd been faster maybe I could have made a difference. Before I could ask her what she meant 
[00:00:36]: [Noel?] then came over and started telling…and she started telling me all about the job opening. He was grateful for the lead, we've all been struggling. It's hard to believe. Went over to her house hoping I can talk to her, then I…about the night Nick died. She said she'd been having a rough time that night, was preoccupied with some work problems. Then I decided to go for a drive, try and clear my thoughts, but it only got worse from there. When I asked about stuff she'd left at the bar she got really anxious and said we shouldn't talk here. 

	[00:01:11]: So she said before, if only I'd been faster maybe I could have made a difference.
Part 38:

M1	[2023/05/17 16:05:17 GMT+0000]: And the stuff she left at the bar? So strangely enough…

F1:	So she was going to tell them something about…

M1:	What she left at the bar was the…

F1:	Was the… I need to 
[00:00:09]: [voices overlap]…

M1:	…the matchbox. And the menu. But the matchbox then later shows up – assuming it's the same matchbox – shows up at the crime scene. Assuming that's a crime scene.

F1:	Did we get the date? I can't forget. What's 
[00:00:23]: [voices overlap]

M2:	Yeah, that was the…

M1:	That was 
[00:00:24]: [voices overlap]…

M2	[00:00:24]: [Voices overlap].

F1:	Oh, okay. And what's in the bag?

M2:	The will, and…an envelope.

M1:	Yeah, this envelope.

F1:	What's this again?

M2:	Crap, as far as I can tell.

F1:	Shift one.

M1:	Explanations.

F1:	A-B. Oh, we need to figure out what this code is.

M1:	No, but he got that already. 

M2:	That's…that one's done, there was a piece of paper with it on.

M1:	So is it…? Do we just do those three in order then? Shift one, shift three, and shift eight?

M2:	I don't know. I didn't get as far as figuring that out. There's also there's four oh seven written above it, but that didn't work.

M1:	Oh, shift…shift four, shift zero, shift ten. 
[00:01:23]: Shift…
M2:	[2023/05/17 15:59:35 GMT+0000]: [Voices overlap] a picture.

M1:	Yeah. So that might be this picture. But we need to double check that he has a Toyota, maybe.

F1:	He does. 

M2:	Yeah.

M1:	Oh, he's got a Toyota. Okay. So this is his, so that's his… So and then…

F1:	Okay. 

M1:	…this one…

M2:	And that's the same.

M1:	…image through the… So this one, the front we match to this front.

M2:	Yeah.

M1:	And then we match that back, to that back.

F1:	Okay. 

M1:	So that's correct. But we have another shoe, that has the same
[0:00:25]: track pattern at the bottom. 
[00:00:28]: [Turn this?] a bit? No?

F1:	But I think that's 
[00:00:29]: [what's happened?].

M2:	So this has got 
[00:00:31]: [voices overlap]…

M1:	That's a different…that's a different one.

M2:	…two rings of…hmm…on the outside.

M1:	Okay. Yeah. And…but Chris also doesn't live at something that ends with a number two. Right?

F1:	Where he lives…

M1:	He's at one three one Carmichael, and this is something, number two. So let's see if this 
[00:00:50]: [voices overlap] if this shoe is in here as well. That would make it easier. Which shoe is this? That looks a lot like this shoe.

M2:	Yeah.

M1:	Which is a difference…different tread.

M2	[00:01:00]: Yeah. 
Part 39:

F1	[2023/05/17 16:06:41 GMT+0000]: Oh, my God, I'm so confused. I'm just going good old-fashioned…

M2:	Four zero seven.

F1:	…assumptions and accusations. 

M2:	Gut feeling. 

F1:	Gut feeling. 

M2:	The four oh seven is also part of the address, so that might just be coincidence. Who knows? Well… Other than the person who's sat laughing on the other side of the table. 

F1:	Three oh four.

M2:	Mmm.

F1:	Is there a three oh four somewhere? No, that was four oh seven.

M2:	Three oh four could be the…

M1:	Winning number.

F1 [00:00:35]: December 7th at [moon set?] three oh four, he's killed just after it. Oh, Goddamn it.

M2:	What?

F1:	I think we need to make a…I think it's Chris, or Sherry. I don't think it's Donna or Joan, we've got them ruled out.

M1:	Okay. 

F1:	Joan's got a motive, Joan's got an alibi. And so has Donna, she was trying to save him.

M1:	Yes. 

F1:	Yeah. So they two are out. It's Chris or…and/or Sherry. Stop laughing at me.

M2:	I'm not laughing at you, Elaine.

M1:	No, no, no. But we cannot say…

M2:	I'm laughing at…

M1:	…it 
[00:01:15]: [can?] be Sherry, because Sherry was in the back yard making a scene.

F1:	Oh, yeah. Yeah. She was… But I think the two of them were in it together.

M1:	Yeah. Sure. But then if Sherry is in the back yard creating a scene, it's not her.

F1	[00:01:21]: He's there.
Part 40:

M2	[2023/05/17 16:08:04 GMT+0000]: He's the one who did it.

F1:	He did it. 

M2:	He did it. 

M1:	Yeah. But it can't be…we can't be, like, confirmation bias-ey like, oh, yeah, he did it, and then 
[00:00:14]: [voices overlap]…

F1:	Well, wait. Wait. Let's just go through the evidence that we've got for him now. Boots.

M2:	Yeah.

M1:	Check.

M2:	His boots.

F1:	Check.

M1:	So just to make sure, that photo 
[00:00:25]: [voices overlap]…

M2:	In his Toyota.

M1:	…that photo is from the crime scene. Yeah?

F1:	No. This photo is from 
[00:00:29]: [voices overlap]…

M2:	From the back of his car.

M1:	No, that one, the…with the footprint.

M2:	This one? No idea. 

M1:	Ah. Because that's what we're going on at the moment, I think.

F1:	December the 7th at 3:33am, that's just after he was killed.

M1:	No, but that 
[00:00:52]: [on the left is] him, isn't it?

F1:	Who? Nick?

M1:	Yeah.

M2:	It's a ghost.

F1:	No. 

M1:	I think it is. Is it not? Yes, it is. Because that on the right is the lady who was saying, oh, yeah, and then when I turned around…

F1:	Oh, well, he's waiting outside and he's gone, and it could be 4:30am he was killed.

M1:	So…so but then indeed it means that at three…

M2:	Is that not…

M1:	…if this is 3:33 then the coroner said it was between 3:30 and…

F1:	And 4:30.

M1:	…4:30, but then it's not that close to 3:30…

F1	[00:01:16]: Yeah.
Part 41:

M1	[2023/05/17 16:09:21 GMT+0000]: …because he was still there.

F1:	Is that 
[00:00:10]: [him?]? Because she gets a ticket at 3:31.

M1:	Oh. But then she's lying.

F1:	No, she can't be lying.

M1:	Oh, no, can't be lying.

F1:	Because that's when she gets a ticket.

M1:	Because it's… Ah, no, but if she gets the ticket then she's still made it to the…to the CCTV thing.

F1:	I think we 
[00:00:26]: [voices overlap]…

M1:	Where is the CCTV from? From the bar. Right?

F1:	I don't know. 

M1:	Fuck, we don't know. We… I don't know 
[00:00:33]: [these days?].

M2:	Probably from the 
[00:00:34]: [voices overlap]…

M1:	I just assumed that that's the 
[00:00:35]: [customer?].

F1:	Did we…? So you figured this out?

M2:	That one. Yeah.

F1:	What does it say?

M1:	Erm, 
[00:00:42]: [nothing?] useful.

M2:	When you've…it's the Sherlock Holmes quote, right? That one.

M1:	Yes. 

F1:	When you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however impossible, must be the truth. It's him.

M2:	There we go. It's the last piece of the jigsaw that we needed.

F1:	Did we need…? What's in his will?

M1:	What?

F1:	What's in his will?

M1:	His will says, I'm leaving a little bit of money to save the Devil's Well thing. Then a bit to some other people.

F1:	Wait. Carmen gets his whole estate?

M1:	Who is Carmen?

F1:	The person who's had…and that's…the person who's reported it.

M2:	Yeah.

M1	[00:01:17]: Oh.
Part 33:

F1	[2023/05/17 15:58:10 GMT+0000]: And so…and she's definitely like, oh, we need to get rid of him, to Chris. But then she creates an alibi. And he does it. She creates an alibi by going and making a big…

M1:	Ah, on purpose. 

F1:	…loud noise somewhere else. 

M1:	Mmm.

F1:	And like it's both of them there. But actually he's bloody pushed him off a cliff. And he's…that's why he's wanting to…

M2:	It's him. 
[00:00:20]: [Voices overlap] him.

F1:	It's him. I think we…

M1:	It's him. But why? I mean, we need to establish that is the case.

F1:	Well, his means is that…he's a bloody police officer.

M2:	Mmm. 

F1:	And he can go where he likes and do what he likes without being questioned. I think that's what's happened, because this could go on.

M1:	But…okay. So that you got something about having a peek through the back window of a car. Right? 

F1:	Yeah.

M1:	So we have a photo of that.

M2:	Where was that?

F1:	That was Carmen, the woman who's bring the complaint to the detective agency. And she says…

M1:	Does it say what type of car it was?

F1:	…oh, he's into hiking. Ran into her…where was that? Oh, wait a minute. Visited him at home, seemed annoyed at first, let me in. Then she finds the envelope. 
[00:01:08]: Just on my way out I took a peek into his car and noticed something that might be useful.
Part 42:

F1	[2023/05/17 16:10:40 GMT+0000]: Oh, my God.

M1:	Okay. 
[00:00:06]: [Voices overlap]

F1:	Oh, no, wait a minute. Donna Marie Goddard, in recon-,…I provide that she shall receive free drinks. Right. You're not going to kill anybody over that. Carmen, as thanks for a steadfast service, I leave the remainder of my estate including the Old Scratch Tavern and all associated assets
[00:00:24]: [voices overlap]…

M1:	I didn't realise that was her.

F1:	…the balance of my entire 
[00:00:25]: [account?] and a payout of life insurance. Should she fail to survive me, the remainder of her estate goes to her sister. What did she say about her sister, at the start? Where's her…?

M1:	Her letter. This is her letter, isn't it?

F1:	Oh, my God, I've just got chills.

M1:	But that's good because now we know why it's on the branded letterhead of the bar, because it's now her bar.

M2:	Mmm. 

F1:	Oh. Let me give you a little background, I learned everything I know from my bartending boss, Nick 
[00:00:56]]: [Webster?], he taught me how to pull a perfect pint. He even helped me arrange my work schedule so I could be home more when my sister was sick last year. He's leaving everything to her. It was her.

M2:	Carmen?

F1:	Yeah. I think it's her.

M2:	She's the one who hired us. Right?

F1:	Yeah. 

M1:	Yes. 

M2:	And that's why 
[00:01:14]: [voices overlap]…

F1:	Trying to make 
[00:01:14: [voices overlap]…Part 43:

M2	[2023/05/17 00:00:06 GMT+0000]: Yeah. Okay. It was her. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
 F1:	Trying to make out like it was the police officer.
 M1:	Okay. 
 F1:	I have intention… No, wait a minute. I have intentionally omitted in this will to provide for my spouse. 
 M1:	Yeah. Yeah. You 
[00:00:14]: [voices overlap]… 
 F1:	She 
[00:00:14]: [did?] and she gets nothing. She's got no 
[00:00:15]: [voices overlap]… 
 M2:	[00:00:15]: [Voices overlap] knew that she was having an affair? 
 M1:	Yes. 
 F1:	I know you have never cared much for the bar, but I thought at least you still cared for me. I was a fool. 
[00:00:25]: [I would have thought?]. Are we agreed? 
 M2:	Yes. 
 M1:	Well, but do we have… 
 M2:	Yes. 
 M1:	So there are many things we haven't used yet 
[00:00:33]: [voices overlap]… 
 M2:	No, no 
[00:00:33]: [voices overlap]… 
 M1:	…so this… 
 M2	[00:00:34]: [Voices overlap] no, no. 
 F1:	I know. But I think that 
[00:00:36]: [voices overlap]… 
 M2:	No, no, you've just forgotten how we used them all earlier. 
 M1:	This… 
 M2:	No, that's 
[00:00:41]: [voices overlap]… 
 M1:	This. Right? Yeah, with 
[00:00:42]: [voices overlap]… 
 M2:	But that says it was Carmen who did it. 
 M1:	[00:00:44]: [Voices overlap]. 
 F1:	It's…listen, it's either down to Chris Thompson, who's too obvious, maybe. 
 M2:	Yeah. 
[00:00:50]: Yeah.Part 44:

F1 [2023/05/17 16:12:52 GMT+0000]: And so we think, as a majority, that it was… And I know you will find this difficult to agree to because 
[00:00:08]: [you would like to go to the end of earth?], but I think it was actually Carmen.

M2: Yeah. Agreed.

M1: But then…but then what's the task? Well, do we need motive, means, and
[00:00:20]: [voices overlap]…

F1: No, we need to tell Ella 
[00:00:20]: [voices overlap]…

M1: …so we have motive…

M2: We just need to 
00:00:21]: [voices overlap]…

F1: …who we think it is. Do we?

M1: Do…? What's…

F2: Yeah. As well as why and how.

M1: Oh, why and how.

F1: How?

M1: Shit. Well, how? By pushing down the thing.

M2: Oh, were they having an affair?

F1: Because she was at the bar, she knew his movements, so everybody else[00:00:38]: [voices overlap] is under suspicion apart from her. She goes and pushes him off the…

M2: This is a good point, actually.

M1: But… Yeah, so if she is…and the guy isn't there as well, then… So okay. So for some reason…

M2: But this might not be a person. 

M1: These guys are trying to scare him.

F1: Mmm. 

M1: And that gives her the opportunity…

M2: Mmm.

F1: Mmm.

M1: …to murder.

M2: Opportunity. There you go. 

F1: There you go.

M1: And to… And to then blame it on the…M2: Motive…M1: …on the devil 
[00:01:02]: [inaudible].

M2: [00:01:05]:…for the inheritance.Part 47:

F1	[2023/05/17 16:16:38 GMT+0000]: No, we didn't find anything.

M1:	But surely the…

F1:	Well, I think we should just leave it at 
[00:00:07]: [inaudible].

M2:	Maybe that's the…

M1:	Code. And… Oh, bollocks. That was the…

F1:	Right. Oh, are you going to do that before we make a decision?

M1:	Oh, Jesus.

M2:	Well, we've got about an hour then.

M1:	No, but which of the two then?

M2:	But they can't both be using the same code. Right?

M1:	Oh. Ah, this one I wrote down, didn't I? Okay. That's up. That…this can't be…I don't think this will be correct, because…

M2:	Also I'm missing three letters from the end of the alphabet because I ran out of space on the page. That might make things slightly different.

F1:	How do you annotate laughter?

F2:	It's not 
[00:01:12]: [voices overlap].

M1:	Yeah. It does complicate it a little bit, John, thank you.

F2:	Do you want a Post-It note?

M1:	So that's an X, Y, Z. Right?

M2:	Stick a bit on the side.

M1:	Z, Y, X. That's three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

M2:	Also all of them, so far, I don't know if this is the way you did it, have been going…

M1:	Backwards.

M2	[00:01:25]:…backwards. 
Part 46:

M2 [2023/05/17 16:15:11 GMT+0000]: Seems like a Joan thing, to me.

F1: Really? As…

M2: Good old Joan.

F1: Good old Joan.

M1: So why…? So is this the phone number of one of the people on the files?

F1: Okay. 

M2: I don't…couldn't see the phone number. 

F1: What's it…what's it end in, Jackie?

M1: Ends in 6104. Is that a phone number in the US?

F1: Yeah. 

M2: Mmm. 

M1: Does look like that. Yeah. 

F1: Yeah. 

M1: Shall we call it? There's no telephone number on there.

F1: There's no phone numbers on here.

M1: None on there.

M2: I can't see phone numbers anywhere.

M1: Not on here.

F1: I don't think we've done really well.

M2: I think we've absolutely lost it.

F1: I think it should have been…even if it isn't Carmen 
[00:00:59]: [voices overlap] it should be.

M1: It should be Carmen.

F1: That makes a better ending.

M2: That does make a better story. And…

F1: Doesn't it?

M2: …with all of the kind of, you know…well, you just need to rule out all the people it can't be, then it's like, oh, it's the person who hired us who did it. Oh, my God, what a surprise.

M1: Okay. So is there a phone number on here somewhere? No. 

M2: No phone numbers 
[00:01:25]: [anywhere?].Part 45:

F1	[2023/05/17 16:13:59 GMT+0000]: Motive is the inheritance. Means is… 
 M1:	Well, the means in some sense it's that she has…that she… 
 F1:	She's not under suspicion at all. 
 M1:	Well, and…and there's the…
M2:	How. 
 F1:	How. 
 M1:	The how. By, yeah, pushing him down the hill. But…but yeah, it is a bit weird that that guy now in some sense is a witness. Assuming there's a guy there, because then… 
 F1:	Maybe that is, like, Chris Thompson, or whatever, because him and…his wife is trying to make a deal to sell everything. 
 M2:	Yes. 
M1:	Yes. So Chris Thompson is just trying to 
[00:00:37]: [voices overlap]… 
 F1:	So he's walked into 
[00:00:38]: [voices overlap]… 
 M1:	…just trying to scare him. 
 F1:	Yeah. Terrorise him. That it's him and the wife that are terrorising him. 
 M1:	But the other one… So why were they leaving the fox? I don't know why they were leaving the fox. We also haven't looked at this, I think, there. Have we? 
 F1:	What does it say? 
 M1:	Well, interlopers will be banished to the bottom of Devil's Well. And that happened. 
 M2:	Mmm. 
 M1:	Right? So…but… 
 F1:	But anybody could have… 
[00:01:03]: [Carmen could?]… I don't know. And who did this? Was that Joan? 
 M1:	Yeah, most likely. Yeah. 
 F1	[00:01:11]: Yeah. Part 52:

F1	[16:23:56]: I'm writing because I think my boss was murdered. Let me give you background. I learned everything I know about bartending from Nick Webster. 

	And this is when he says that he let her work different shifts so she could look after her sister. I guess that's why it hit so hard. 

	The official story is Nick was drunk and lost his footing. There's too many strange things that have happened leading up to the accident. The thing is Nick had been seeing the devil, for months he'd be telling anyone who'd listen that there was someone or something lurking in the woods behind the bar. First everyone assumed he was exaggerating for the sake of a good story. Nick could spend the whole night in the corner with spinning yarns. Anyway…blah, blah, blah. He had no reason to…he was obsessed with figuring out who was to blame. He'd stay in the bar's office for hours poring over security camera footage. 

	Yeah, which… So she just happened to find the…she happened to find that, and he did it. Oh, that's 
[00:00:56]: [inaudible].

	He was obsessed with figuring out who was… One… On the night he died I'd just closed up when he came out of the office and said he'd finally figured out… That's why she killed him. 

M1	[00:01:04]: Yeah.
Part 53:

F1	[2023/05/17 16:25:01 GMT+0000]: He came out of the office and said he'd finally figured it out. But before he could explain he saw someone outside and ran off into the woods – that would be her mate she's got to do that – my back was to the door so I didn't see anyone. By the time I'd turned around 
[00:00:19]: [voices overlap]…

M2:	Her back was not to the door. Lies.

F1:	She's bloody… Both Nick and the devil were gone, and that was all was left was the small burning fire outside. I can't help wondering what he would have told me if he had the chance. After his death it was ruled an accident. I went through and found all the notes he'd been keeping about the devil, and a locked deposit bag I haven't even figured out how to open.

	What was in the bag again?

M1:	The testament, and correspondence about…

F1:	Yeah, she's lying about that. Finally 
[00:00:54]: [caught on camera?], like Nick had been trying to do for months. I took the evidence I found to the sheriff but he didn't care Nick was really chasing after someone that night. 
[00:01:02]: Official determination Nick slipped and fell, but the thing is I went out to the place where he died.Part 48:

M1	[2023/05/17 16:18:04 GMT+0000]: Backwards. Yeah. That's what I thought. So… No, so this won't be correct. Because none of them start with V.

F2:	Do you want the last three letters?

M1:	No. That's… No, it can't start with V, I don't think, so it might be this one. But if this is minus four. You said you already did that. Right? Bless you.

F1:	What was that? 
[00:00:45]: [Voices overlap]

M1:	So this way, that's the original, and this becomes that. Yeah? So that's minus one, two, three, four. So then…then we've got an A, it's possible. And then zero, not possible. 

F1:	I'm just reading her…

M1:	One, two, three, four.

F1	[00:01:19]: [her boss?] at the Grey Investigations, and she said, Carmen's already managed to identify four clear suspects, each of them more than capable of committing the crime. As you're working through the case pay attention to your suspect's means, motive and opportunity. Only a combination of all three will reveal the killer. So is it one of them?

M1:	What?

F1:	Is it one of them?

M1:	At the beginning…

F1:	Yeah, but…

M1:	…they were also saying everybody could be lying.

F1:	Okay. When it comes to alibis you should be able to corroborate everyone's
[00:01:48]: [voices overlap]…

M1:	Well, but she was saying everyone could be lying. 

F1:	Anyone could…

M2	[00:01:52]: Yeah, but that's the…
Part 51:

M1	[2023/05/17 16:22:26 GMT+0000]: It's him, and it's the lady that wrote us the letter. And it's at 3:30 in the morning, just before he died. And then there's a guy in a…or someone in a… 
 M2:	Devil mask. 
 M1:	…devil mask outside, grinning at them. She reported seeing him; turning around, the two of them are gone. 
 M2:	Mmm. 
 M1:	In the meantime, for some reason Joan knew this was going to happen – or Donna, or whomever, the lady who got the ticket – knew this was going to happen, and she came to try to warn him, or save him, or whatever. 
 M2:	Mmm. 
 M1:	But wait a minute. Oh, crap. No. Who is Carmen Rochas? Oh, that's the lady… Okay. Yeah. 
 M2:	Oh, my God. 
 M1:	Sorry. So yes, these…this is…these are Nick and Carmen on the photo. Yes. Okay. 
 F1:	Could we…? Before we make our declaration, can we read through Carmen's letter once more and see if we can pick anything up? 
 M1:	Sure. 
 F1:	Because I think she did it. 
 M1:	Yeah. 
 F1:	Right? 
 M2:	Which letter is this? 
 F1:	Carmen… 
 M1:	The one… 
 M2:	Oh, the other one. Yeah. 
 F1:	This is Carmen writing to the investigator. On her own headed paper now because she runs the 
[00:01:24]: [voices overlap] place. 
 M1:	Yeah. 
 M2	[00:01:28]: Yes. Exactly.Part 49:

F1	[2023/05/17 16:19:58 GMT+0000]:…anyone can prove 
[00:00:02]: they weren't at the site of the… Anyone who can prove they weren't at the site of the crime is probably clear, but it's not enough to simply exclude innocent victims. To truly crack this case, you'll need to work out the real 
[00:00:13]: [criminalise?] and why… Oh, yeah, but… I say it's… Well, if it's one of the four, then it's Chris.

M1:	Great. If it's her. Right?

M2:	Mmm.

M1:	If the police has 
[00:00:32]: [voices overlap]…

F1:	I think it's her.

M1:	…established it's an accident.

F1:	Mmm.

M1:	That would be great for her. Right. So then why would she hire the three of us to look at it again?

M2:	It's a valid point.

F1:	To validate…

M1:	But to validate what? Because she's off the hook at the moment.

F1:	Well, can we 
[00:00:51]: [voices overlap]…

M1:	If she did it.

M2:	Well, maybe she'd heard that we're really shit.

F1:	Okay. It's either Chris or Carmen.

M1:	Oh, we're back to…

F1:	Sherry, remember, was at the…his house.

M1:	Yes. So it's not Sherry. Because she was at the house.

F1:	Not Sherry. And not Joan.

M1:	It's not Joan because…I don't know why not 
[00:01:16]: [voices overlap]…

F1:	No, she had an…she had…

M1:	Okay.

F1:	…she was 
[00:01:19]: [voices overlap]…Part 50: M1	[2023/05/17 16:21:18 GMT+0000]: She didn't do it. F1:	…remember Mia, from the forum, with this weird lady. M2:	She was the one with the bees and the herbs. M1:	Yes, and we think it's that one 
[00:00:05]: [voices overlap]… F1:	Yes. From 2:30. M1:	We think it's her. F1:	Mmm. And Donna got a ticket at 3:30 for speeding. But it sounds like she was trying to save him. M1:	And she was trying to save him instead. F1:	Maybe not. It was probably her, but we can't…we'll be here all day. M1:	Okay. So the thing is if it's Carmen, it wouldn't make sense that she hires us. M2:	No, this…that's her…that's the thing that convinces me most, she would have hired better investigators…

F1:	Yeah. M1:	Yes. F1:	If that's a really good board game that's an amazing twist. M2:	Yeah. Exactly. M1:	Yeah, but… F1:	And we've solved it. M1:	Yeah, but why does she then [mobile phone rings]… F1:	Sorry. M1:	Oh, that's so good. F1:	Gosh. Sorry.

M1:	Did you pick up? No? F1:	No. M1:	Accidentally.F1:	I'm solving a murder here, I ain't got time to answer the phone. M1:	So… F1:	I think we've… M1:	…on this photo… F1:	…we've done all we've got in our…

M1:	…it is 
 [00:01:06]: [voices overlap]…it is him. Right?Part 54:

F1	[2023/05/17 16:26:08 GMT+0000]: How does she know where it is? Oh. And I don't think the authorities even bothered to look any further than the spot where the body was found. There was caution tape found on the rocks but nothing up at the top of cliff. The ground near the ledge didn't look like it had been disturbed since Saturday night, and if the authorities had been there there's no way they'd count out foul play.

	So if the authorities haven't been there, how does she know where to go?

M2:	Exactly. Exactly.

F1:	Somebody in a devil mask was really there… Somebody in a devil mask really was there that night, and whoever pushed it…whoever it was pushed Nick off that cliff. The sheriff may not believe me but I must be making someone nervous. I've started getting threatening letters, just like the ones Nick did before he died. I know I'm close. I'm sending you all the evidence I've collected in the hope that you will be able to do what I can't.

M2	[00:01:07]: [Inaudible].

F1	[00:01:09]: [I think it's her?].

M2:	Mmm?

F1:	So I think it's her. You don't… Who do you think it is? So can we have two people? We think it's Chris…because he's the only one that we can't get an alibi for.

M1:	So should we try to decode these messages?

M2:	You should. 

F1:	You should. Because we're…

M1:	Okay. 

F1:	Well, who 
[00:01:38]: [voices overlap]…Part 57: F1	[2023/05/17 16:31:34 GMT+0000]: I'm going to get this game for me and my sis… Well, yeah, and I'm going to say I've never played it before. This is on the same paper.
[00:00:22]: [Just try it out?]. I'm just… F2:	Shall I give you the instructions in the instruction book, that about the code breaking? F1:	Yeah. M2:	The ones you said made it too easy. F2:	I thought. F1:	We're only doing this for Jackie. We're only prolonging this for Jackie, really, I just don't care if I'm wrong. M1:	Okay, we're done, are we? M2:	Good. So that's a decision? Elaine?

M1:	Oh, 
[00:01:04]: [voices overlap]?

F1:	Yeah. On me. That's it. I… M1:	No, on who? F1:	Oh. Carmen. M1:	No, you didn't do it. 

F1:	Carmen. M1:	On Carmen? Yeah? Are we going Carmen? I think 
[00:01:13]: [voices overlap]… F1:	And if we're wrong, then it's me that's predominantly pushed the Carmen angle. Although John was… M1:	Onboard. F1:	…came along with me. M2:	Well, it's 
[00:01:22]: [I'll hold up] on that. M1:	I think it's strange that Carmen hires us. But, hey-ho. M2:	She's trying to frame someone else. F1:	She's trying to frame, put someone else 
[00:01:31]: [voices overlap]… M1:	Oh. F1:	Okay. Can we say that we think it's Carmen, but if it wasn't then it was Chris? M2:	We can. F1:	Let's say that. M2:	We're saying that. F1:	We're saying that. 
[00:01:41]: [End there?]. F2:	Okay. Decision? F1	[00:01:43]: Yes. Part 58:

M1	[2023/05/17 16:33:18 GMT+0000]: Oh, shall we stop the recording now? This is the…

F1:	No. 

F2:	No.

M1:	Oh, damn it. Are we not done yet?

F1:	She's going to open the envelope to see 
[00:00:07]: [inaudible].

M2:	Part two.

F2:	I have actually 
[00:00:14]: [inaudible] episodes.

F1:	I'm leaving.

F2:	Who would like to…

F1:	Me. Can I? Do you mind?

F2:	Yes. Go for it. Spit it out.

F1:	Webster… Webster's death or murder suspect arrested. The death of Old Scratch Tavern owner Nicholas Webster has been reclassified as a murder according to official paperwork filed this week. Though Webster's December 7 death was initially ruled an accident, the case was recently reopened as a homicide. Sheriff 
[00:00:47]: [inaudible] – no, I don't know why, just now getting a sinking feeling – Paul McGinty confirmed a suspect is now in custody in connection with Webster's death. Shit. Sherry Webster, the victim's widow, has been charged with the murder of [00:01:04]: [his?] husband.

M2:	She's innocent.

F1:	The motive of which is believed to be financial gain. The sheriff's office announced there will be an external enquiry into the handling of this investigation into Webster's death. While Sheriff McGinty would not discuss the scope of this enquiry, he did confirm that Deputy Christopher Thompson, the officer in charge of the original investigation, has been suspended without pay. According to Carmen Rochas – she did it – an employee at the bar Mr Webster owned, the case was solved thanks to new evidence uncovered by a private investigator. 
[00:01:37]: None of this would have happened without the help of Grey Investigations, she said, I will always be…
Part 55:

M2	[2023/05/17 16:27:48 GMT+0000]: I'm just going to head off, give me a ring when you're done.
 F1:	Who do you think it…? Who do you think did it? Do you not know who…? Do you not have a firm idea? The only person out of those four suspects that I think is Chris…
 M1:	Yes. 
 F1:	…and if it's not him it's Carmen. And she…I've got that feeling. And even if we're completely wrong, well 
[00:00:20]: [voices overlap]… 
 M1:	So I agree that it would be great 
[00:00:21]: [voices overlap]. 
 M2:	So that at least the pain will be over. 
 F1:	Yeah.
 M1:	Oh, God. 
 F1:	And I think you've got what we…you were looking for, in terms of… 
 M1:	Of course. 
 F1:	…filming it, have you? 
 F2:	Absolutely. 
 F1:	Yeah? 
 M2:	More than. 
 F1:	Oh, yes. 
 M1	[00:00:33]: [Voices overlap] two, three, four. In which case then… 
 F1:	I'm more than prepared to be wrong. 
 M2:	Mmm. 
 F1:	Are you? 
 M1:	Well… 
 M2:	Better to be wrong quickly, than… 
 F1:	Mmm. 
 M2:	…right in another hour. 
 F1:	Are you getting someone, another group, to do this? Oh, my God, we're going to be in competition. That's what…that's how he needs to get it right. 
 M2:	They've already had another group do it. Right? 
 F1:	Are we the second group? 
 M1:	Yes. 
 F1:	Oh, no. 
 M2:	It's not looking good. 
 M1:	Okay. So… 
 M2:	That's kind of what I did. 
 F1:	Wait. Did the other group get it right? 
 F2:	I'm not saying. 
 F1	[00:01:13]: Right. Okay. Okay. Part 59:

F1	[2023/05/17 16:35:00 GMT+0000]: Hey, at one point I said she did it, didn't I? I said it was her.

	I will always be grateful to the investigator who worked the case. Hello, investigator, nice work, thanks to you Sheriff 
[00:00:17]: [inaudible] and your client, Carmen, found justice for her friend. I knew you were up to the challenge. You can bet I'll be turning to you for help on future cases too. Congratulations on your s-, failure. 
M1:	Right. And find the next one. 
 F1:	We did at one point think it was her, didn't we? 
 M2:	We did. We did. 
 M1:	Of course. 
 M2:	Oh, we definitely… Yeah. Yeah. 
 M1:	But, she… 
 F1:	Remember when…we did, didn't we? 
 M1:	What's the financial gain? Because she didn't get the place. 
 M2:	She didn't know that the will had been changed, maybe. 
 F1:	Yeah, but… 
 M2:	Because the will was quite recent, I think. 
 F1:	Ah, yeah, but she… Maybe she did, but she had to kill him so she could sell the… Oh, no, wouldn't be. What?
 M1:	Yeah. I don't… 
 F1:	She didn't think…she did think… 
 M2:	Sherry is innocent. 
 F1:	…it 
[00:01:00]: [would?] be her. 
 M2:	Free Sherry. 
 F1:	Yes. 
 M1:	I don't actually get it. 
 F1:	Free Sherry.
 F2	[00:01:04]: So it was…Part 10:

F1	[2023/05/17 15:21:15 GMT+0000]: Is that for the… Oh, no, this is another one. 

M1:	Oh, that's a different one, yeah, that's a different one.

F1:	Yeah. But this happened…CR66. Oh, right, okay, that's the motorway, isn't it? And Eagleton Creek Road.

M1:	Country roads here, 66. Yeah.

F1:	Sixty-six. That's it. Right. Okay. 

M1:	That's that one. 

F1:	So this must be…wait a minute, it's 3:31, traffic stops silver Lincoln, that's this, lights out. Warning. He was given a warning.

M1:	Mmm.

F1:	So do we know if any of the suspects owned any of…?

M1:	Yeah. Could be. Yeah. 

F1:	Oh, my God. Donna Goddard's got a silver Lincoln Continental. What are you smiling at? Registration…vehicle registration. That's the same one. Right. So…

M1:	Yeah. So it's her car. So has she got the car?

F1:	Where is she? So 3:30…where is she? Donna Goddard. The body was found at…where's the police report? Here. The body was found at 6:37. Okay. Where is this? [Died?] 
[00:02:01]: 06:37.

M1:	So…

F1:	She was stopped when?

M1:	About 6:30…

F1:	Three. No, 3:31.

M1:	Yeah, 3:31. Okay. And you were just reading in some other report.

F1	[00:02:17]: Mmm.
Part 4:

F1:	[2023/05/16 16:08:30 GMT+0000] I'm sure my deputy would have discovered any signs of foul play, he said, we're looking at someone who was a little worked up, who'd had a drink or two. It's tragic but accidents happen. And Webster's widow, Sheri, said in a statement, 'I have faith in the Sheriff's office, and I'm grateful for their help.'

	Maybe we should draw out like a, so we've got, Nick Webster, and then he had a wife.

F2:	Yeah, has she got a name yet?

F1:	Sheri, S, H, E, R, I. And then…

F3:	Bartender, Carmen?

F1:	Yeah. Okay.

F3:	Did they mention anybody else.

F2:	Well there's the deputy…

F1:	Just the Sheriff.

F2:	…and he's got a deputy as well, so the Sheriff, Paul McGinty, and he also mentions his deputy but not by name. 'Cause he said, 'The deputy investigated it, and he would have told me if there was something.'

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	So it almost feels like Paul McGinty hasn't investigated anything, he's just quoting other people.

F1:	Yeah. So, the widow Sheri, said in her statement, 'I have faith in the Sheriff's Office and I'm so grateful for their help. Nick was the love of my life, I don't know what I'll do without him. She did not address whether Old Scratch Tavern 

[00:01:30]: will reopen, but Perdition's residents will surely miss their favourite neighbourhood bar-keep.'
F2:	[2023/05/16 16:05:56 GMT+0000] Early hours, and how did he die?

F1:	Fell to his death.

F2:	Fall? Yeah, I thought it was, early hours of Saturday?

F1:	Aha. It was dark, and unfortunately Nick just lost his footing, McGinty said at a press conference, Monday morning.

F3:	So blunt force trauma or something? Something like that?

F1:	Maybe, yeah.

F2:	And he was leaving work, was he?

F1:	Yeah, leaving the tavern.

F2:	Leaving the tavern.

F1:	A neighbour discovered Webster's remains at Devil's Well, a local waterfall, early Saturday morning.

F2:	Oh.

F3:	Okay, where was it found?

F1:	At the bottom of Devil's Well, a local waterfall, early Saturday morning.

F3:	Okay.

F1:	This is not the first misfortune to befall Webster and his tavern in recent months.

F2:	Mmm.

F1:	Interesting. In July, Webster told this paper, nothing valuable was stolen following a series of petty burglaries, but he said he was taking measures to ensure the incidents did not continue. Sheriff McGinty confirmed that no perpetrator was apprehended for the thefts.

F2:	Several, he just says several does he?

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	And how many before, was the time before it happened, recent?

F1:	In July.

F2:	[00:00:47]: Okay.
Part 6:

F1:	[2023/05/16 16:11:31 GMT+0000] So it says, 'The scenic waterfall, just outside of Perdition, could be included in the sale of land if negotiations proceed.'

F3:	What does that mean, sale of land?

F2:	Oh there's an incentive.

F1:	So, someone could sell the land that has the waterfall in it. So, will I just…?

F3:	Who does it belong to?

F1:	I'll read the thing and see if we find out. Also, so the article's written by Boyd Blumenthal?

F3:	And this is Mitzie.

F1:	And this is Mitzie Sutherland, so they're, what they're called, journalists?

F3:	Aha. 

	We should write the sheriff in as well, I imagine

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	So this is Mitzie, a main article, and this is a Devil's Well article?

F2:	Yeah, and I think that has got a clue in it. I'll just have a look there's no adverts, I was just seeing if there was any adverts, but no.

F3:	Just [holiday craft market?] 

[00:01:15]: here.

	What's this…Boyd…Blumenthal.

F2:	So there's a potential motive, money.

F1:	Yeah, so Monday's town council meeting turned contentious, when a preliminary hearing about selling a parcel of municipal land, ended in threats against the council members. So there was a town meeting, and it turned contentious, so I'm assuming they mean there was like arguing and stuff, 

[00:01:49]: when hearing about selling the land ended in threats against the council members.
F1:	[2023/05/16 16:04:45 GMT+0000] Let's try figure out our suspects, maybe.

F2:	You've got four of them?

F1:	Yeah. So okay, so we've got…a CCTV camera…

F2:	Of a man and a woman.

F1:	Okay.

F2:	And there's someone in there as well.

F1:	Oh, so this is, Old Scratch owner's death ruled an accident.

F2:	Ah.

F1:	So this is Nick Webster. R…

F2:	Old Scratch, what's that mean? Oh…

F3:	Wait, was Nick, yeah, the Scratch was the victim right?

F1	He was the owner of Old Scratch Tavern.

F2:	Oh, owner. Oh yeah, it's a dive bar.

F1:	And this is Carmen
[00:00:37] [Rohas?]

F2:	She's the lady who came and hired the person, but she might still be the murderer, you never know, but she's unlikely.

F1:	Yeah, Carmen and…does that look like Carmen as well in that video?

F2:	Yeah, it does.

F1:	Yeah, it's Carmen.

F2:	I don't think it's her, but we just shouldn't…

F1:	Yeah.

	So the Sheriff's office announced on Monday that it's ruled the death of Old Scratch Tavern owner Nicholas Webster, an accident, according to Sheriff Paul
[00:01:01]: [McGinty?], Webster fell to his death in the early hours of Saturday morning, likely minutes after leaving Old Scratch Tavern.
[00:01:08]: So the early hours of Saturday, he died.
Part 5:

F1:	[2023/05/16 16:10:10 GMT+0000]
	Okay, so now we've got someone new, Carole Euber, a member of the old Perdition billiard's club said, 'Old Scratch's Pool Championship won't be the same without Nick Cheering us on.'

F3:	Okay, yeah, so that's just another, like, person who knows him.

F1:	Aha. So Carole…E, U, B, E, R…then we've got Donna Goddard.

F3:	This is the 

[16:10:36]: [inaudible] person?

F1:	So these are all just people who seem to be supportive. She says she's a longterm patron of Webster's bar, it's heartbreaking, like mad the best old-fashioned gin in town, and I won't be the only person having one in his honour tonight. So…

F3:	Clients.

F1:	Yeah. And funeral services will be held Sunday at 11am at 

[00:01:02]: [Bogg's?] Funeral Home. 

F2:	Funeral…on Sunday at 11am.

F3:	So it hasn't been a week, so…

F2:	So if that's Tuesday…

F3:	It doesn't mean he died on…

F2:	That will be the 6th, 7th.

F3:	Seventh.

F1:	Yes, if he died on, if this is from Tuesday, and he died on Saturday, so that would have been December 7th.

F2:	Oh good.

F1:	Yeah, and then the reception after the funeral would be at Old Scratch Tavern, so his tavern.

	Okay, on the other side of the newspaper, new developments for Devil's Well. Is this the waterfall that he died in?

F3:	[00:01:20]: Yeah.
Part 9:

F3:	[2023/05/16 16:16:02 GMT+0000] So the guy died on 7th December, right?

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	When you're saying, yeah, December, you're saying that's the…?

F1:	Day before.

F3:	The day before.

F2:	Yeah, 6th December. 

F1:	So the message says, 'Hey, I know it's last minute, but is anyone going to this Banishing Ceremony out by Devil's Well tonight?'

F3:	Okay, so…that was on the 6th.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Oh they're indicating that maybe he was at one of those…

F3:	So we need, guys, we need a timeline.

F2:	Well, I think we keep getting the information, yeah, 'cause I think we're going to rewrite the timeline. 'Cause I think this is suggesting a sacrifice.

F1:	'I've seen flyers around town and it sounds cool, but also, do you want to get murdered or whatever? Anyone know who's organising or what their deal is?' So then someone's saying, 'No idea who's running it, but I wouldn't hang out with a bunch of strangers in the woods at night.'

F2:	That's her, isn't it? 

F1:	Yeah Mia Roma, asking what's going on with this Banishing Ceremony.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	Oh she went. Okay, sorry. So someone said, 'I can't make this ritual, I'm at a coven meeting in Indianapolis tonight. '

F2:	Oh my goodness.

F3:	Oh for fuck's sake guys.

F1:	[00:00:32]: But I promise you'll come to no harm.
Part 11:

F1:	[2023/05/16 16:18:10 GMT+0000] 'I guess it was just an animal or whatever. Then she hands me the shovel and tells me to start walking. I thought she was going to kill me for sure, instead she made me pick up a dead fox off the side of the highway and carry it over to this old dine bar. She made me put the fox on the ground by the mail box, and she covered it with the ashes from the fire, and yelled for Vinegar Tom, whatever that means. After that she thanked me for helping support the cause, and asked if I needed help getting back to my car. Anyway, I guess Perdition has its very own witch, but at least I didn't die. Seven out of ten, would go again.'

F3:	So she spends like 30, 40 minutes burning herbs and chanting, I heard something crashing around in the bush, and I got worried she'd actually summoned something, but it was just an animal. Then she handed me the shovel and said…’ So I wonder if that sound was a fox, or if that was Nick Webster…

F2:	Someone dragging the…

F3:	So if that was the Nick Webster, the timeline is just between 9.27 on Saturday night, and 4.47 Friday night, Saturday morning. So this is the…

F1:	They said he died in the early hours of the 7th, so that makes sense.

F2:	Who's the witch?

F1:	[00:00:36]: We don't know, we don't know. 
 Part 8:

F1:	[2023/05/16 16:14:19 GMT+0000] 'We think this could greatly enrich our town,' said Lynch, 'But of course, if everyone is against it, the deal won't go forward.'

	So potential motive, did you have…yeah, we could have potential motive as something to do with the sale of the waterfall.

F2:	Yeah, I feel Dale Lynch, isn't totally, he said, 'If there's enough against it, it's advantageous, but if no one wants it…'

F1:	The deal won't go forward.

F2:	So I don't think he's the one that's benefitting particularly, except he might have bribes, but yeah, he's sort of…

	[00:00:46]: [voices overlap]

F1:	I think, just because, he was killed here, it might be a way to like, discourage the sale of the land, and make it worth less, if there had been…

F3:	[00:00:55]: [inaudible]

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Or I think we'll probably find out that he's got shares or 

[00:01:02]: [inaudible]

F1:	Yeah, let's see there'll be more, lots of…

F2:	That's good, there was a lot in there.

F1:	I know.

	Hopefully that's the most heavy bit done. Well, Ella's laughing, maybe not. 

	Okay, so we have blog posts or social media posts of some sort. So, 

[00:01:24]: [Mia Roma] someone from Perdition.

F2:	Oh, put dates.

F1:	Are these in American format, 6th December 

[00:01:30]: [inaudible].

F3:	Oh for fuck's sake.

F1:	But it could also be the 12th June.

F3:	Let's see more., 12, 7…

F2:	Seven, 12…so it looks like it's December, 'cause this is continuing on, I think it's December.

F1:	Yeah, I think it's December.

F2:	[00:01:43]: So it's…yeah.
Part 3:

F3:	[2023/05/16 16:06:43 GMT+0000] So he died early Saturday morning, and he was found early Saturday morning, right?

F2:	Oh what's the newspaper, paper, 'cause this, he must have died in December?

F1:	Yeah, it looks like it.

F2:	'Cause this must be, he died…

F1:	So, 'More recently Webster had reported a series of small fires and other disturbances at the bar. Official records show that Webster called Perdition emergency services ten times between September 1st and December 7th.'

F2:	Ten times, let me get the dates again?

F3:	So what happened there?

F1:	September 1st and December 2nd. So they were fires, and he called emergency services.

F2:	So, it's several petty burglaries in July, a fire in September, and he called ten times, so that's a bit poor.

F1:	Yeah, several. So then Carmen was a bartender at Old Scratch and said that Webster feared someone was out to get him, though she didn't know who would have wanted to harm her employer.

	So the circumstances of Webster's death led some Perdition residents, including Rohas, to speculate whether his fall might have been accidental. So that's Rohas as in Cameron Rohas. However, Sheriff McGinty was adamant these claims were groundless.

F2:	So who thought it might be…?

F1:	So Carmen Rohas, yeah.

F2:	Oh, Carmen, okay

[00:01:45]: [voices overlap], okay, yeah.
Part 7:

F1:	[2023/05/16 16:13:30 GMT+0000]
	The meeting, scheduled originally for 13 minutes, continued for over an hour. When Joan Campbell…we don't know who that is yet, right?

F3:	Yeah.


F1:	…Joan Campbell stood up during the question and answer period, the tone of the discussion quickly became tense. Campbell identified herself as the founder and sole member of the Save Devil's Well Foundation, an organisation she claimed is devoted to protecting the wilderness around Devil's Well. She accused the council of accepting bribes and claimed that Devil's Well is a sacred site that deserves official protection. She ended by threatening…

F3:	Secret or sacred?

F1:	Sacred. She ended by threatening to come to the councillors' homes and 'Do to you what you what to do to your environment.' Security attempted to remove Campbell from the meeting, but she resisted, injuring a bystander in the process. 'No one was seriously hurt,' said councilman Dale Lynch, 'But none of expected this to get so ugly.

F2:	What was the councillor's name?

F1:	Dale Lynch.

	The proposed sale would include roughly 600 acres of land west of town, most of which is old growth forest, as well as several residential and commercial properties. 

[00:00:40]: There's no word yet about the purpose about the sale, for Lynch stated that the council considers a deal advantageous. 
Part 10:

F2:	[2023/05/16 16:16:37 GMT+0000] Who's that, Doreen?

F1:	Doreen Norville seems like she knows what's up.

F3:	Oh so this, what's her name, Joan Campbell, the Save Devil's Well Foundation person, is a fricking cult person, 'cause she called it sacred.

F1:	Oh maybe.

F3:	Looking at Ella.

F1:	Okay, so update. 'So I wound up going by myself, and it was totally bonkers. I got there at like three in the morning, and it was just me and this lady with a basket of weird herbs.

F3:	It was Campbell, right?

F1:	Maybe.

F3:	Probably.

F1:	'We spent like, 30 or 40 minutes burning herbs and chanting. At one point I heard something crashing around in the underbrush and I got worried she'd actually summoned something.

F2:	Oh well he died on 7th September.

F3:	Yeah, exactly.

F2:	So, that was the Friday night.

F3:	And she posted…

F1:	Four am, on the 7th.

F3:	So she was there.

F2:	Yeah. So, I think this is…

F1:	Yeah, so, 'Out by Devil's Well tonight,' and this is the 6th, so it went out on [inaudible]

[00:01:23]: morning, so this is, the man died when this was going on.

F3:	Yeah.

F2:	[00:01:30]: So this is, yeah.
Part 12:

F2:	[2023/05/16 16:18:50 GMT+0000] Okay, there's a witch.

F3:	No, well that's probably the…Joan Campbell.

F2:	And was it called someone called Vinegar Tom?

F1:	For Vinegar Tom. So this is weird, they dragged a dead fox over to the dine bar, so his bar…

F2:	Yeah, that is weird.

F3:	Oh.

F1:	It's very bizarre.

F2:	But I think she's innocent, and she didn't see a body. So in some respects, we know the body wasn't there before. She might have heard it, but she didn't see it.

F1:	Yeah, like Mia Roma didn't see it, but whoever this witch is seems suspicious.

F3:	Will we be able to use the screens?

F4:	I mean, if you want.

F3:	To take notes for our timeline.

F4:	Would you like to?

F3:	Well, if we could, yeah, later on. I just need to know what to write on the timeline.

F4:	Sure, I'll set it up.

F1:	Okay. So now there's an early morning on the 7th.

F2:	What time was that, did she post that?

F1:	At 4.47.

F2:	Okay, so that's, okay, that's a really good post.

F1:	Yeah, so, 'Carmichael Road 

[00:01:10]: Residents Beware. If you live on Carmichael Road, and want to sleep through the night, good luck. I didn't get a wink of sleep last night, because my neighbour's inconsiderate hussy of a girlfriend, shows up to his house at all hours, and be as disruptive as possible. I swear she knocked on every single thing in his backyard, letting herself into his house. 

[00:01:32]: Then she turned on all the lights, which shine right into my bedroom windows. 
F1: 	[2023/05/16 16:20:30 GMT+0000]
I don't know what possessed her to start playing music so late, but I assume it was to annoy me personally. Thankfully it stopped after a couple of hours, but not before I was robbed of my beauty rest. This isn't the first time they've been inappropriately loud, you'd think they would have the decency to be ashamed of themselves, but no, they're determined to make a mockery of law abiding residents in this peaceful community.’

	I wonder if there's anything about Carmichael Road?

F2:	I think that might come up, because if anything came out on that, it suggests that they wanted to make a noise to hide some activity.

F3:	This is the morning of Nick Webster's death?

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Yeah the 12th…he died on the 7th, it's the 7th, yeah.

F1:	Yeah.

F4:	That it's sorted for you, 

[00:00:29]: [inaudible].

F3:	Yes, thank you.

F2:	What was the piece of information, do you think they've given us, if we were going to thingy it?

F1:	We should look to the comments, 'cause maybe it's here. 'Oh so, that's what the noises around 2.30 last night. Maybe try sleeping with earplugs, why so judgemental, I agree they could be more considerate, your neighbours, but [inaudible] 

[00:00:46]: besides, who are you to cast the first stone [inaudible] 

[00:00:50]:? Okay. Strange.

F2:	[00:00:55]: 'Cause that could either be, is she going to have this as an alibi or that she was trying to cover up some noise, it could be either.
F1:	[2023/05/16 16:24:22 GMT+0000] So we've got a letter.

	'Dear Ms Gray, I'm writing because I think my boss was murdered, but I can't prove it on my own. I'm hoping someone at Gray Investigations can help me. I may give you a little background. I learned everything I know about bartending from my boss, Nick Webster. He taught me how to pull a perfect pint, and coach me on [inaudible] 

[00:00:18]: rowdy patrons. He even helped me rearrange my work schedule so I could be home more, when my sister was sick last year. 

	Nick was the best. Old Scratch Tavern isn't much to look at, but it's one of those places that feels like home. That was all Nick.'

F2:	Nice guy.

F1:	Yeah.

	'I guess that's why it hit me so hard when Nick died in December, it was so sudden and so bizarre. The official story is that Nick was drunk and lost his footing, but to me, strange things happened in the months leading up to his death, for me to believe it was an accident. 

	The thing is, Nick had been seeing the devil.'

F3:	That happens when you drink too much, and then you stop drinking.

F1:	Or when someone's in a cult, sacrifice, who knows?

F3:	That's alcoholic delirium.

F2:	Or he's trying to mess with your mind.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	[00:01:06]: I mean like playing games.
F1:	[2023/05/16 16:22:50 GMT+0000]
	So, 'Dear Miss Gray', do we know who Miss Gray is?

F2:	I haven't got a Gray on my notes yet, although we've got a few neighbours and witches, so we've got a few un-named people.

F3:	So witnesses, would be Mia, right, and Helen G?

F2:	Yeah, Mia at the waterfall, and Helen G in the town.

F1:	We know the road name, right?

F2:	Oh yeah, I have Carmichael Road.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	But Helen doesn't live in that road, that was the person, that's where…

F1:	That's where the noise was though.

F2:	Yeah, the first noise.

F1:	Well some, the first noise, yeah. We don't know about Helen? Okay.

F3:	So what was here?

F1:	Just the complaints about noise and we're thinking 2.30 is maybe relevant.

F3:	Mmm. This is Dale Lynch. Dale Lynch, we've heard Dale Lynch.

F2:	Oh, Dale Lynch. Dale Lynch…

F1:	Is the council man.

F3:	The council man, what did he say?

F2:	Yes.

F3:	What did he say? Maybe try a sleep mask and earplugs 

[00:01:21]: [inaudible].

F1:	I know, weird for a council man to be like…

F3:	It's a small town, right?

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	[00:01:27]: But yeah, but okay.
F1:	[2023/05/16 16:25:30 GMT+0000] 'For months he'd been telling anyone who'd listen, that there was someone or something lurking out in the woods behind the bar. At first, everyone assumed he was just exaggerating, but for the sake of a good story, Nick could spend the whole night in a corner, both spinning yarns and telling tales. But there's no way he could be making up the creepy notes he was getting, or the dead animals on the doorstep, or the fires that kept flaring up near the building.'

	So dead animals on the doorstep, we know there was a witch getting people dragging foxes and things.

F2:	There was dead animals, creepy notes, and what was the third thing he was getting?

F1:	Fires that kept flaring up near the building.

	'So he had no reason to make it up, not when things were getting so dangerous, someone was trying to scare him, maybe even scare him to death. He was obsessed with figuring out who was to blame. He'd say in the bar's office for hours, poring over the security camera footage and scribbling notes. 

	On the night he died, I'd just closed up when he came out of the office, and said he'd finally figured it out.' Interesting.

F3:	On the night he died, so that was Friday 6th.

F2:	And…

F3:	Did it say when?

F1:	'On the night he died, no, I'd just closed up, when he came out of the office and said he'd finally figured it out.'

[00:01:05]: [voices overlap]
F3:	[2023/05/16 16:26:33 GMT+0000] Do we know when the bar closes?

F2:	I have been wondering, when does the pub close?

F3:	Okay, so somewhere there is a sighting of him?

F2:	Yes, we've seen him at the bar close, whatever time that is?

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Yeah, I think they might tell us.

F1:	Before he could explain, he saw someone and ran off into the woods.

F2:	Oh he ran into the woods? Well that was silly of him.

F1:	My back was to the door, so I didn't see anyone. By the time I turned around, both Nick and the devil were gone.

F3:	Oh my God.

F1:	And all that was left, was a small fire burning outside. After I put it out, I waited for Nick, but he never came back. 

	So, they did say they covered the fox, with like ash from the fire, so I assume it's this one that was like burning outside the bar?

F2:	Yeah, someone's taunting him. I think someone's trying to get him to run into the woods.

F3:	Oh wait, so the, how said there was burning stuff? That's the Mia story, right?

F2:	That's…who said…

F1:	Yeah, Mia's story. 

	[00:00:21]: So, 'She made me put the fox on the ground by the mailbox, then she covered it with ashes from the fire, and yelled for Vinegar Tom.'
F1:	[2023/05/16 16:21:33 GMT+0000] Someone said, oh, that's what the noise was around 2.30, maybe…

F2:	Ah, 2,30, oh yeah, yeah, that is…

F1:	At 2.30 someone heard noise, and then they're assuming it's this, but it could have actually been to do with the murder.

F2:	Ah, that might be the important bit. There's a clue in there, and I think you're right, I think it's that one.

	Who said that actually, who's the…Helen, 'cause she might come back.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	So she might be just complaining about a neighbour, and this person's provided us with a clue.

F1:	Yeah, so if you're doing a detailed timeline with times on that day, around 2.30 a noise was made as well, if you want to add that in?

F3:	So I'm going to put here, December 7, and that would be 4.47, that's when Mia came back.

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	Four forty seven am, Mia 

[00:00:59]: [inaudible]. And then so this is, 9.27, so I guess somewhere here we'll have, what time was it, 2…? 

F2:	Two thirty was the noise.

F2:	Two, so that would be December, 7, 2.30.

F1:	Yeah, a noise was heard by Helen Garbinstky.

F3:	Noise…Helen, I'll just do Helen G so…

F1:	[00:01:10]: Yeah, so we've got a letter that's on Old Scratch Tavern printed paper.
F1:	[2023/05/16 16:27:40 GMT+0000] Let's see, okay?

	'I took the evidence round to the sheriff hoping it would change his mind, but he didn't care that Nick really was chasing after someone that night. The official determination is still that Nick slipped and fell of the cliff, but the thing is, I went out to the place where he died, and I don't think the authorities have even bothered to look any further than the spot where they found Nick's body.

	There was caution tape down on the rocks, but nothing on top of the cliff.'

F2:	What's she saying about, they didn't even…can I see that sentence?

	'They didn't bother to look any further than the spot where they found Nick's body.

	Okay, so they haven't investigated the area. 

F1:	So she's saying, 'Caution tape on the rocks, but nothing up at the top of the cliff, near the ledge. It didn't look like it had been disturbed since Saturday night, and if the authorities had been there, there's no way they'd count out foul play. Someone in a devil mask really was there that night, and whoever it was, pushed Nick off that cliff.

	The sheriff may not believe me, but I must be making someone nervous by looking into Nick's death. 

[00:02:20]: I've started to get threatening letters, just like the ones Nick was getting before he died. I'd be lying if I said I'm not scared, but those threats also prove I'm onto something, don't you think?'

F2:	She should be. I think so.

F1:	'I know I'm close, but I've got questions I can't answer. I'm sending you all the evidence I've collected in the hope that you'll be able to do what I can't, and bring my friend's killer to justice before it's too late. 

[00:02:37]: Sincerely, Carmen.
F1:	[2023/05/16 16:31:47 GMT+0000] So notes, oh, there seems like these are notes from Nick, 'cause it says, my favourite regular at Old Scratch, comes in three to four times a week, kills at karaoke, mops the floor with the competition at pool, always tips well. Handled the sale of the bar when Nick bought it. Okay, never mind we'll read Carmen's notes. Handled the sale of the bar when Nick bought it in 2005, the seller was [Lou Lavalle?]

[00:00:17]:, his father opened it in 1957. So Lou Lavalle was selling the bar. Very involved around town, women's choir, billiards club, [Brown and Country?]

[00:00:28]: hiking club. Billiards club? That was mentioned.

F3:	Yeah, in the article, that she likes to play. No wait, was she the one playing billiards, or was it…?

F2:	There was pool.

F3:	Carole Euber.

F2:	Carole Euber said the pool championship won't be the same without him.

F1:	Okay. Last person to leave the bar the night Nick died.

F2:	She was?

F1:	Yeah, Donna.

F3:	Last, maybe one hour before closing time. Okay, so I need to…

F2:	Have you got a time of what the last person to leave the bar, have we got that time?

F1:	No, just that it was about an hour before closing time, but maybe that means around 2.30.

F3:	Aha.

F2:	[00:00:55]: Mmm, yeah.
F3:	[2023/05/16 16:27:03 GMT+0000] But she didn't burn it, and she put out some fire.

F2:	Mmm.

F1:	Yeah, so she put the fire out, so then that's the ash they covered it in, but, we don't know who started the fire.

F3:	So somebody started the fire, and then they came and used the ashes to cover the fox.

F2:	But I think they've set a fire to get him to chase them, I think it might have been a ploy to get him to follow them into the woods.

F1:	Yeah, maybe, yeah.

F3:	Okay.

F1:	'I can't help wondering what he would have told me if he'd had the chance. After his death was ruled an accident, I went through and found all the notes he'd been keeping about the devil, and a locked deposit back I still haven't figured out how to open.' Okay. 'I even found proof that the devil was real, finally caught on camera…

F2:	Oh, we've got the CCTV camera, I was wondering where that was.

F1:	It will be this, right?

F2:	Ah.

F3:	Ooh.

	Oh, fuck off.

F1:	… like Nick had been trying to do for months.

F3:	Oh guys, guys, look at the time on the, December 7th, 3:33am.

F2:	Oh, that's locking up time?

F3:	That is locking up time. Oh that might be…

F1:	So he was still alive at 3:33.

F3:	Three, thirty…and the noise was at 2.30am.

F1:	Okay, so maybe that was just other noise.

F3:	[00:00:31]: Well maybe that was, yeah, maybe that was the noise that Mia heard when she was in the woods. Remember, because Mia heard…?
F1:	[2023/05/16 16:32:50 GMT+0000] Which is late for her. 'She seemed on edge, but when I asked if everything was okay, she shrugged it off, left a note on her menu, and a matchbox on the counter for Nick.'

F3:	Oh no, I cleared everything.

F1:	Is there an undo button? Oh, there we go.

	So she left a matchbox and a note on the menu. Is this a menu? No, this is, oh this is a flyer for the 

[00:00:36]: [inaudible].

F3:	What?

F2:	She left, it's an empty matchbox. Ooh…

F1:	Aah, it's got a number on it.

F2:	I see the phone number, or it's not the code, just, oh no, it won't be.

F3:	What?

F1:	It's on the menu, so I'm looking for the menu, it looks like this is it. 'We need to talk.'

F2:	Oh, we need to talk, and maybe…

F1:	Oh.

F2:	Oh. Oh. When you stay…

F1:	About Devil's Well…

F2:	Talk on Wednesday about Devil's Well and 11pm. So she wants to meet on Wednesday at 11…a…

F1:	Eleven pm, Wednesday. 

F2:	That's weird.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Unless they want to talk about the…11, it wasn't that the…

F1:	About land?

F2:	The council meeting wasn't on Wednesday was it, it was on a…?

F1:	[00:01:30]: But this is weird, because if she left this the night he died, then that would have been for after he was already dead, right?
F1:	[2023/05/16 16:35:13 GMT+0000] 'At the funeral reception, we talked about how Old Scratch was like a second home to her, however, everyone there could see what a special place Nick had made it. It looked like she'd been crying a lot. We talked afterwards, just reminiscing. She said something really odd, like, if only I'd been faster, maybe I could have made a difference.'

F2:	So who was that that left that, just to make sure, I've got a Post It Note.

F1:	Donna Goddard.

F2:	'Cause I'll put that one, so we don't have to remember it for long.

F1:	Yeah.

	'Before I could ask her what she meant, Nolan came over and started telling him about a job opening for a fry cook at [inaudible] 

[00:00:56]: Diner. He was grateful for the lead, we've all been struggling to find work since Old Scratch closed. It's hard to believe we'll ever find another job as great.'

	'I went over to her house, hoping I could talk to her about the night Nick died. She said she'd been having a rough time that night, was preoccupied with some work problems.'

	'Then I decided to go over for a drive, and clear my thoughts, but it only got worse from there. When I asked about the stuff she left at the bar, she got really anxious and said, we shouldn't talk here, and hustled me out of the house in a hurry.'

F2:	Oh. 

F1:	'Tried to call her, no answer. Called her office, and they said she left on a business trip, not sure when she's supposed to get back.'

F2:	So, but this meeting on the menu, could have happened, that was his notes?

F3:	No, this is not his notes, this is…

F1:	[00:01:23]: This is like Carmen's notes.
F2:	[2023/05/16 16:30:20 GMT+0000] Oh, she's done quite well.

F1:	Yeah. Okay. So, I…

F2:	Who's the letter to, let's have a look, and when did she send…oh it's not got a date?

F1:	To Mrs Gray. Is it Gray Investigators, we're working toward, yeah.

F2:	Yeah, I just wondered if there was an address.

F1:	Yeah, Michelle Gray, that's who sent us this stuff.

F3:	Yeah.

F1:	Okay, I'll move some of the stuff to the side.

F2:	Okay, so that makes it…there's no dates or anything on this? Oh, there's an address of the tavern, 6 County Road, 66, on here.

F1:	Okay.

F3:	Was that the tavern?

F2:	Well, it's writing paper, so I assume it is.

F1:	Yeah, so it was Carmen that sent it, so yeah.

F3:	Aha. So country road and these people we're talking about…

F1:	Carmichael Road.

F2:	Carmichael Road. Okay.

F1:	Maybe there'll be a map somewhere, where we can place where things are. So then there's these personal files, from a database. So we've got Donna Goddard, oh, she was a client who spoke well of him. Oh are there four, are these the suspects? One, two…

F2:	Oh, are they the suspects?

F3:	Finally.

F1:	Yeah, there's four, okay, right. Donna Goddard…

F2:	Donna Goddard was a long time patron of the bar, according to the newspaper, and said, he made the best [long fashion?] 

[00:01:15]: in town.

F1:	Okay. So, she works as a real estate agent.

F2:	Mmm, okay. 

[00:01:26]: Very dodgy.
F3:	[2023/05/16 16:37:38 GMT+0000] This is a witchy lady, come on.

F1:	She's a bee farmer, sells honey at local farmers' markets.

F2:	So she got assaulted, and what was the other thing she was assault and…

F1:	Assault and trespassing.

F2:	Trespassing.

F3:	So her house is near to Old Scratch?

F1:	There's not much else nearby.

F2:	And she's divorced.

F3:	Eccentric, to put it mildly, I told you it's a witch lady.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Yeah, I think it's a distraction.

F1:	'On night's the bar's busy, she'll sit in a chair by the roadside and curse people driving by…'

F3:	She didn't kill because she was together with Mia, right, most of the…?

F1:	Potentially. 'And not foul language, she genuinely believes she's putting hexes on people.'

F2:	Well she does sound like…you're right. 

F1:	She does sound quite witchy.

F2:	We haven't confirmed though, that she is the…

F3:	She is.

F2:	I think she is…

F1:	I think you're probably right, but we shouldn't…

F2:	Yeah, we'll make that as a theory that we need to confirm.

F1:	Yeah, I agree, but let's see.

F2:	Potentially, the witch lady.

F1:	Yeah. 'Apparently she's been claiming…

F3:	[00:01:21]: [Inaudible].
F3:	[2023/05/16 16:36:38 GMT+0000] '…Carmen's notes.

F2:	Carmen's notes. And that was the night, sorry just to clarify, that was the night he died, he gave that to her, according to Carmen's notes?

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	So did they say Donna left the bar one hour before the closing time?

F1:	Yeah, 'The last person to leave the bar at the night, Nick [inaudible]

[00:00:30]: had left an hour before closing time, which is late for her. Left a note for Nick, but he never got the chance to see it.'

F2:	The worst thing she's done in all of this, is she's a Real Estate Agent, and we always think they are the murderers. 

F1:	But she seems very suspicious of something.

F2:	Yeah, she almost seems on his side though, don't you think?

F3:	I think it doesn't matter, let's keep on going doing the timeline.

F1:	Okay, so then we've got Joan Campbell, who…

F3:	That's the witchy lady.

F1:	Well, the Save Devil's Well Foundation lady, we don't know if she's the witch but…

F3:	I'm hypothesising.

F1:	Yes. She lives on County Road.

F3:	Oh, is it all in America?

F2:	Yes.

F1:	Oh, so she lives on the same road that the bar's on, County Road. Background check, there was an arrest for assault, the charges were dropped. Arrest for trespassing, charges were dropped. 

[00:00:57]: And a one no contest divorce.
F2:	[2023/05/16 16:34:29 GMT+0000] Yeah, but let's say he was saying, I want to talk about the Wednesday meeting. It could have been the previous Wednesday's meeting, it might not be she wants to talk on Wednesday.

F1:	Or wants to talk about land, Wednesday, Devil's Well, 11pm. 

F2:	But he died on the Saturday.

F1:	Yeah, so he was already dead, but maybe about land, so about like the land with the…

F2:	One of my questions is, when was the council meeting, the controversial meeting?

F3:	Yeah.

F2:	Because if that was a Wednesday, that would be interesting, 'cause they might want to talk about the meeting. Meeting's…on Monday.

F1:	Oh Monday.

F3:	Monday would be December…no.

F1:	It would have been Monday the 9th, I think.

F2:	Okay.

F1:	Oh wait, did they mention anything there?

F2:	That's a Tuesday, so yeah, it must be the Monday meeting. Yeah, then they've reported it the next day, so it was the previous day. Okay, that was on the Monday, so it's nothing about the…that's not, so it's not Wednesday meeting, so that's fine, it's not that she wants to talk about.

F1:	Yeah, I think it's about land, when they say Devil's Well, 11pm, like this is time and place?

F2:	Yeah, I think so. And she's given a phone number, maybe, we don't know, but we'll leave this out.

F1:	Yeah, okay. But he never got the chance to see it, so…

F2:	[00:00:43]: Yeah.
F1:	[2023/05/16 16:39:02 GMT+0000] …some evil corporation from Indianapolis wants to sow the land near Devil's Well with poison or something.’

F3:	Sorry, what?

F1:	She's claiming that an evil corporation from Indianapolis wants to sow the land near Devil's Well with poison.

F3:	Or something.

F1:	Or something.

F2:	Ah, but she might be right, there might be a corporation wants to buy it, and she's just got, because she kind of sees the evil in everything, sees evil. So that might be a factor might it not?

F1:	'It sounds pretty out there to me, but I've heard stranger things I guess. Then again, she's also been saying Nick got what he deserved, so who knows?'

F2:	Oh.

F2:	Aha.

F1:	Interesting. 'Went over to her place, hoping to ask her some questions, but she said she won't talk to interlopers from Old Scratch bent on destroying life.'

F2:	She's bonkers.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	But she also put a fox outside his bar, so I think we knew that already.

F1:	'Then she threatened to shoot me if I don't get off her property, so I left.'

	But said, Old Scratch bent on destroying life, so she obviously thinks Nick and the bar are doing something bad.

F2:	[00:00:58]: I think you're right.
F3:	[2023/05/16 16:40:03 GMT+0000] What?

F1:	She said, 'Interlopers from Old Scratch bent on destroying life.'

F3:	Oh.

F2:	Oh, interlopers? In old, what was the word exactly?

F1:	Interlopers. Where is it, it's about here.

F2:	Interlopers from…okay.

F1: 	'I've never understood why she hates the bar so much, just that the bad blood goes back a long time. I wish I could ask Nick. There are a lot of things I wish we could talk about these days.

F2:	Yeah, me too.

	I think there's some interesting facts here, that she's shorter than the other lady, she's female, she's younger than the other lady, she lives on that road, she's got a Beetle…

F3:	She's got a bit of a, what do you call it, alibi though, we just don't know when exactly Mia was at the thingy, so when that happened.

F2:	I have to say, I'm not convinced that she's a murderer.

F3:	Yeah, I know.

F2:	But she's not the most reliable witness either.

F1:	It might be like, you know, she was doing weird things and leaving the foxes and stuff, so maybe we're meant to go down the road that she did it, maybe it's…

F2:	But maybe she had some reason to, I wonder if it's the reason she's doing it, is what's going to be important in the story?

F1:	[00:00:51]: Yeah.
F3:	[2023/05/16 16:41:00 GMT+0000] So, okay, so like, so who's the first person, Donna?

F1:	Donna.

F2:	Donna, yeah. She's the Real Estate person,

F3:	Who is this one?

F1:	Joan.

F3:	Joan, and then what we need is motive?

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Motive means an opportunity.

F1:	I'll just read this last bit about Joan.

	'I snuck onto her property when I knew she'd be in town. I took a picture of something that looks promising, but I'm still waiting on the results from the [Deviant Tracker Boot Tread?] 

	[00:00:36]: database, which I'd prefer the pro version, because light isn't impressing me.' Okay.

F3:	Okay so…

F2:	So I think there's going to be something in her house that's going to be useful, but I still don't think she's the murderer. But I'm [inaudible]

	 [00:00:46]: keeping it open.

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	So let's look at my table. So we have Donna, does she have a motive?

	Let's do more of a question mark, or more like certainly. Because I don't think we should write detailed things here, but…

F2:	Yeah. Well we could ask it, and then ask it again. She was the last person to leave the bar before the staff, so she might have hung around.

F3:	So the opportunity is potentially?

F2:	She left a matchbox, so she wanted to talk to her. I'm not convinced, unless it was a trap.

F1:	Should we look…oh yeah, but…

F3:	But we don't know her motive, right?

F2:	No, we've got no motives yet, I think it's in that pile, the motives.

F1:	[00:01:32]: Yeah, maybe.
Part 33:

F1:	[2023/05/16 16:44:38 GMT+0000] There's like registration numbers and stuff on all of these, but we'll see. Right, 'Went to high school with my sister, she said he was popular but had a reputation as a ladies man. Very outdoorsy, always hunting or fishing, whatever's in season. Went to talk to him at the Sheriff's office on Tuesday, he confirmed that Nick's blood alcohol level wasn't off the charts, 0.06 is tipsy but not seriously impaired.' F2:	He hadn't been drinking. F1:	Yeah. Or like just a tiny bit.

	'When I pressed him for info he told me the details aren't being made available to the public, said Nick's death was tragic, but accidents just happen sometimes.' Yeah, right. F2:	Actually, can I ask a question. Did the sheriff say he'd been drinking, 'cause that's a conflict, if he's lied, he said there was a minor, as almost you couldn't prosecute, and yet the… F1:	..dark and lost his footing… F3:	[inaudible] 

	[00:00:52]: who'd had a drink or two, it's tragic, but accidents happen. F2:	So he's made a lie, there, which is quite significant. F3:	Well, mmm… F1:	He has maybe had a drink or two. It's saying the level is at tipsy, but not seriously impaired. F2:	Yeah, but I think I would sue someone if I'd had a tipsy, and they accused me of that. I think you could sue someone, they're hinting that, but yes, I agree, it's not a total… F3:	He said Nick's death was tragic, but accidents just happen sometimes. It's tragic but accidents happen. 

	[00:01:05]: He said…F2:	[2023/05/16 16:45:45 GMT+0000] Yes, funny how similar it is.

F1:	Yeah, very similar.

F2:	Oh I see, we're looking…

F3:	So I think either they repeated almost like the same, yeah.

F2:	Yeah, slightly, it's not quite the same story, but yeah, okay. I was just thinking the inconsistency.

F1:	Yeah, okay. 'Visited him at home, seemed annoyed at first, but let be in. Probably didn't hurt that I brought pizza. Snooped around a bit while he was in the kitchen getting plates and stole an opened envelope that was at the bottom of a pile of mail on the table.'

	We should probably find the envelope. This thing.

	'Also he talked about hobbies. He is in the Hiking Club too apparently, he said he's been helping Cherie with some stuff around the house.'

	So Cherie…

F2:	Oh we've had Cherie.

F3:	Wife.

F1:	Is the wife of Nick Webster. 

F2:	Mmm.

F1:	'Just trying to be a friend in her time of need.' Ooh, interesting, okay.

F2:	Did she take it out, or did he give it to her?

F1:	She stole it.

F2:	Okay, yeah, okay.

F1:	'On my way out, took a peek into his car, noticed something that might be useful? 

	Okay, we'll see. 'Ran into him at the Limestone Diner, gave me a bunch of platitudes about moving on with your life, as if he has any idea what I'm going through? After he was done condescending to me, he went to pay his bill, and left his pocket notebook sitting on the table. 

	[00:01:15]: I couldn't resist tearing out a page, too bad I couldn't get more.' 
Part 31:

F3:	[2023/05/16 16:42:34 GMT+0000] The Joan lady, does she had a motive, she doesn't like…

F2:	She thinks the people in the pub are interlopers from Old Scratch bent on destroying life. That's probably her best motive.

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	But it doesn't explain why, so this is just she doesn't like them.

F2:	She has got a history of assault and trespassing, and she's divorced. I don't think that makes you a violent person, but she's unreliable.

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	And means, how many means and opportunity?

F1:	Maybe, because she lives close.

F3:	Maybe.

F2:	Aha.

	The other thing, if he was pushed over the ledge, interestingly, any of them are strong enough to push him over the ledge, but whether he would go on the ledge with a mad…either of these actually.

F3:	Maybe but a potential alibi, Mia?

F1:	This is Joan?

F3:	Joan. 

	[00:00:48]: [inaudible].

F2:	I don't think they would give us an alibi so early on in the story.

F1:	No, I don't think we have any alibis.

F2:	No, not yet.

F3:	No, but it's a potential one, because at some point, Mia and Joan were together.

F3:	Oh, I see, the witch lady, oh I see, yeah.

F1:	Oh right, okay.

F3:	So there's a potential that there is an alibi if they were together, during the murder time or the murder happened before, and then she doesn't have an alibi.

F2:	[00:01:16]: Oh, you're right…Part 35:

F1:	[2023/05/16 16:47:11 GMT+0000] Probably this…

F2:	Oh, she's cheeky.

F3:	Yeah.

F1:	I know. 

F3:	December 7.

F1:	Yeah. 'Showed up at my house later that night, scared me half to death banging on the door, accusing me of theft, and threatened to press charges. I know he won't. If he couldn't even figure out that Nick [inaudible] 

	[00:00:28]:, there's no way he'll be able to prove anything.

F2:	Oh good job.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Oh, there's letters.

F3:	That's 

	[00:00:34]: [inaudible].

F1:	So, we might need, what's at the back of this?

F3:	Maybe let's look at the [inaudible] 

	[00:00:39]: first, and then…

F2:	Yeah, yeah, because…

F1:	And we've also got matchstick…oh no, that had the number.

F3:	Did she have any clues? I don't think so.

F2:	Oh, he lives on Carmichael Street.

F3:	Oh, so he lives next to where the wound was, right?

F1:	Where it was noisy, yeah. Yeah, what's here?

F3:	This is 7th December.

F1:	Batch number 33 is that.

F3:	So that's after the death right, so that's not…

F1:	Okay. Traffic stopped red Honda. Who drives a red Honda?

F3:	So is this the night before, is this about the night of the 6th, or…?

F1:	Well, this 7th at 1am is how I would understand it.

F3:	Oh wait, but that's when the death happened, right?

	So the death happened on the 7th.

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	[00:01:29]: Yeah, okay, so 1am.
F1:	[2023/05/16 16:48:44 GMT+0000] So 1.34, traffic stopped red Honda, going 60 miles per hour, in 25 mile an hour zone, Ames Avenue, by Brewer Hill Cemetery, ticket. [03:12?]

	[16:48:55]: I don't think that one's relevant, but we can see. 

F3:	So I'm just going to take the notes from what he says, in yellow. So that's red Honda…?

F1:	It was a traffic stop, someone speeding.

F3:	Aha, speeding.

F1:	And then 03:12, report of suspicious person.

F3:	Three twelve?

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	Aha.

F1:	Thirteen, CR66.

F3:	So what's happening there?

F1:	Report of suspicious person, 13, CR66. I'm not sure what that means. No sign of unusual activity on arrival, searched property, called in all clear after confirming building secure.

F3:	Is it the address maybe?

F1:	Maybe, like a postcode or something?

F3:	Then 31 traffic stop, silver Lincoln, tail lights out. That's a road CR66, yeah, that's a road.

F1:	Hold on. Silver Lincoln Continental. So that was Donna. [

	[00:01:16]: Lights out…

F3:	Sorry, who is there, Donna?

F1:	That was Donna, that got stopped in her car at 3.31.

F3:	Three thirty-one is [inaudible]

	[16:50:10]. Stopped by Chris Thompson.

F1:	Yeah. Yeah, she was, she had…

F3:	Ooh, so that's 

	[00:01:42]: [when Donna left the bar?].

F1:	[00:01:42]: It says, lights out, I don't know if that means that she just didn't have them on, or something was smashed or…
Part 37:


F3:	[2023/05/16 16:50:40 GMT+0000] Guys, this is weird, Donna left the bar one hour before the closing. At 3.30 there's the CCTV footage, so it doesn't mean the bar closed at 4?

F2:	Well, we've got that she was the last person to leave, and she left, we thought, we put 2.30, 'cause…?

F3:	Yeah.

F1:	But I mean, so this could have been after the bar was already closing, right, because it's just staff in the staffroom… 

F3:	Yeah, but if Donna left at 3.30, she was like, driving and she just left.

F1:	So we assumed 2.30.

F2:	Oh we've got…yeah, we made it 2.30.

F3:	Yeah, but then there's a big time. 

F1:	Yeah, so…

F3:	Aha, okay. So 3.31 Donna sighting.

F1:	Okay. I think that's 401, collision between blue Cadillac and a black Lincoln.

F3:	401, collision. Let's see, eraser.

F2:	A blue what?

F1:	Cadillac?

F2:	Cadillac.

F1:	And a black Lincoln, Hawkins Road, near the Higgledy-Piggledy convenience store, no serious injuries.

F3:	What cars? Cadillac and…

F1:	And a Lincoln.

F3:	So blue and black?

F2:	That was at what?

F1	Four oh one.

F2	Oh four, yeah, okay.

F1:	Yeah, no serious injuries, booked Lincoln driver for DUI. So, driving under the influence.

F3:	So sorry, what time was that?

F1: 	Four oh one.

F3	[00:01:30]: Four oh one, okay.Part 39:

F2:	[2023/05/16 16:53:28 GMT+0000] So that's either… F1:	Neighbour who found a body? F2:	…CR could either be… F1:	She's the only neighbour, Joan's the only neighbour, right? F2:	So CR could be this pub, this, or, both of them have got CR, haven't they? F1:	Mmm. F3:	I would say the death was between 3:30 and 4:00 because collision between the cars, so maybe the cars were getting away, and I would say the death was somewhere here. So 3.30 is the CCTV right, so I would suspect… F1:	Okay. F2:	So CR could be County Road, or it could be… F1:	It says CR66, so County Road 66 makes sense. F2:	Yeah, yeah. F1	'To talk to neighbour who found body,' and Joan said she was the only neighbour, so Joan found the body. F3:	Who's John, oh Joan. F1:	The witch, Joan the witch. F3:	Joan found the body? Wait, what? F1:	So, 'I went to Country Road 66 to talk to neighbour who found body.' And she said… F3:	Yeah, so she was out for a walk right, yeah? F1:	Aha. 55.27 F3:	Oh wait, so [what the hell?] 

	[00:01:24]:, so she did all this weird shit. F2:	Yeah. F1:	So it says, 'her house is nearest the property to Old Scratch, not much else nearby.' So it must be her. F3:	Yeah, yeah, yeah. F1:	[00:01:35]: There you go, yeah, good call.Part 38:

F1:	[2023/05/16 16:52:13 GMT+0000] And then 6:37, possible dead body called in, Devil's Well. Confirmed no signs of life. Called coroner, no ID, but able to confirm victim's identity, secured scene.

	And then 6:59, so not much later, made initial search of area, no signs of struggle on riverbank. A fall from the ledge seems likely.

F3:	Okay, body found 6:47…

F1:	Oh, there's more. There's another side, okay, 7.29 coroner arrived, agreed fall was likely cause of death, says he's probably been dead three to four hours. 

F3:	Okay, so 7.39…

F1:	So that would put it between 5:29 and 6:29, the time of death?

F3:	Sorry, let me just do this, so when was it the coroner arrived?

F1:	Seven twenty-nine.

F3:	Okay, 7:29. And time of death, we're thinking between 5:29, no sorry, between 3:29 and 4:29.

F2:	Yeah, that's right.

F3:	Three twenty-nine?

F2:	Yeah.

F3:	Okay. 3:29, this is 3:29 and what…

F1:	And 4:29.

F2:	Oh, so he left the pub with no…he was alive at 3:33 so we've got quite a close window for his death there.

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	…29, and this is coroner…

F1:	Time of death.

F3:	…coroner…

F1:	Okay, so 8:45, went to…

F3:	Ooh good.

F1:	[00:01:10]:…2 CR66 to talk to neighbour who found a body.
F3:	[2023/05/16 16:55:08 GMT+0000] So did all the weird shit until 4:47 with Mia, and then she kept on doing weird shit without Mia.

F2:	Oh, did she say what time she found the body, 'cause that would be quite good?

F3:	Six am.

F1:	'Stated she was out for a walk shortly after six, when she discovered the body on the rocks, beside the waterfall, and I telephoned to call police, yeah.'

F2:	Okay, that doesn't tell us anymore.

F1:	Yeah. '10:22, back to scene, search of water underway, haven't found much so far, besides some empty beer bottles, probably just littering.'

	'Eleven seventeen, gave up victim to McGinty,' so is he the sheriff? I think so.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	Yeah, sheriff, Paul McGinty. He agrees with accident scenario, will proceed accordingly. 

	Twelve thirty-two coroner, okayed removal of remains. [Morti?]

	[00:00:42]: from Bogg's Funeral Home, to pick up. 

	Thirteen oh five, told Cheri, she took it about as expected. Did my best to calm her down, reassured her foul play unlikely. Made sure she called her mother to come down and stay, so she's not alone at a time like this. Okay.

F2:	So what do you think the interesting facts in that report are, the time of body's the best one, the time of death.

F1:	[00:01:02]: Yeah. 
F1:	[2023/05/16 16:57:15 GMT+0000] Well we thought she'd left about an hour earlier. 
F3:	Yeah, she didn't, we messed up. 
F1:	No, but it said, an hour before closing. 
F3:	Yeah, but the… 
F1:	I guess we don't specifically know when closing was. 
F3:	Oh, you're right. 
F2:	Why would we write 2:30 if we didn't know it? I think we must have… 
F1:	Because we assumed 3:30 here, it was shut.

	[00:00:25]: [voices overlap] 
F2:	…written an hour before. It makes me think we… 
F3:	No, no, an hour's correct, I think she did, it sounded like she left that early.
F1:	'Last person at the bar the night Nick died, left maybe an hour before closing time, which is late for her.' 
F2:	Yeah. 
F3:	And that is probably the closing time, that's, yeah, we assume that this is closing time. 
F1:	Right. 
F2:	So she left the pub at 2:30, but yet she was in the car at 3:30 without her lights on? 
F3:	Yeah. 
F1:	On the street, so it was weird. 
F2:	Of the bar. 
F1:	Aha. 
F2:	So she could have been, actually she was on the street, and he saw something at that time, I mean it could be her. She's… 
F1:	She could be the devil that's taunting him, although that's weird, but maybe. 
F3:	Okay. So… 
F2:	And so we think, there's a possibility that Donna, and Donna's the Estate Agent, isn't she? 
F1:	[00:00:59]:Yeah.
F1:	[2023/05/16 17:00:26 GMT+0000] So she wasn't home, that's odd. 'When I brought up the possibility of foul play, she absolutely refused to consider it. Nick had been behaving so strangely, seeing things that weren't there, drinking too much, I'm sure he didn't even realise what he was doing. She looked like she was about to start crying, so I didn't stay much longer after that.'

	So she's not even wanting to entertain the foul play idea.

F2:	Her motive is that she gets the pub, and maybe anything he owns, so inheritance might, she has to still be a suspect on the wife, inheritance angle.

F1:	Yeah, I think so.

F3:	But what's Chris Thompson's motive?

F2:	Oh, she's staying at a friend's, she could be having an affair. She might, we assumed it was a female friend, she could be…

F1:	She could be having an affair.

F2:	With, yeah, but not with the police detective.

F1:	And, they said, everything is verifiable, right? So we need to confirm that she actually was, 'cause that could be a lie.

F2:	But I would say, probably, I had thought she was having an affair with the deputy, but he was working that night, so I don't think it's him.

F1:	Unless it was the sheriff.

F2:	[00:01:15]: Oh…
Part 46:

F3:	[2023/05/16 17:01:43 GMT+0000] Yes, so what is, does Chris have an alibi? So like, he did some things around the time, right? So at 3:12 he stopped…

F2:	He talked to an awful lot of people in that time. I would say he's the least likely to…

F3:	Donna stopped by Chris at 3:31, I think. Four oh one, collision between the body was found. So maybe here, so he could have done things between but…

F1:	She was working, but, yeah.

F2:	But I think, you're right, I think we're going to have to collaborate and corroborate, because saying he saw a car stop, would be a good alibi, if we didn't double check it, he could have just put that in.

F1:	And especially her being away that night, we're going to need to find evidence of that. Because they said, everything should…

F3:	What do they mean by means. Like, it's not like he was killed with a fucking knife, right? So, 

	[00:00:46]: [inaudible].

F2:	I reckon that's the easiest one, because anyone can push someone over a cliff.

F1:	Exactly like…

F2:	If you're strangling, that's requires a certain amount of strength, but yeah, it's true.

F3:	Yeah, exactly, you already have means right?

F1:	Yeah. Shift one. 

F2:	Except possibly the, is the witch old? I mean, someone who's really frail and old, if you went up against a man, would…

F3:	[00:01:07]: She's not that old.Part 54:

F2:	[2023/05/16 17:12:58 GMT+0000] Okay, so this letter, D, D, O…D… F3:	I assume that's the location of the murder? F1:	Yeah, probably, right. F3:	[Inaudible] 

	[00:01:09]: anything. F1:	So there was something…mmm…this Chris guy's in the hiking club, so hiking boots could be his. F3:	But they're old kind of hiking boots. F1:	Who was it that was…? Oh… F3:	LL Beans but they call it 

	[00:01:40]: [ L-Berry?] F1:	So, 'snuck onto Joan's property when I knew she'd be in town, took a picture of something that looks promising, but I'm still waiting on the results from Deviant Tracker Boot Tread Database.' So they're trying to match, so that looks like the Database. F3:	'Snuck into the property, took a picture.' Oops, I think that's just stuck to me. F2:	Ah, it doesn't make sense. F3:	'Wish I could afford the Pro Version…' What is this? F1:	This is weird…J… 

	So this one is going from the bottom up, by the way, so the coded letter to the answer… F2:	Bottom up. F3:	Too many shoes, I feel like that's just a distraction. F4:	I'm just popping out. F3:	You're not allowed to leave, until we're allowed to leave. F1:	Okay, yeah, this stupid waste of time says, when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. F2:	I'm blaming Ella for that. F3:	Thank you Ella. F4:	[00:01:58]: No problemPart 70: F1:	[2023/05/16 17:43:29 GMT+0000] A back seven.F2	T. F3:	Oh. F2:	So it might be Whitmount or something, whit… F1:	Without, maybe it was meant to be?

	Let's see.

	I feel like you might be right about this affair theory, but let's see.

	C back four. F2:	Y. F1:	B back seven. F2:	Sorry, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, U. Oh yeah, yeah. F1:	V back four. F2:	V back, one, two, three, four, R. [inaudible] 

[00:01:22]: of course. I know, you miss… F1:	We're just us, without your, and then there's a second line.

F2: Oh, okay. You poor thing. F1:	Four oh seven. O back, zero, right, okay, S back seven. F2:	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, L. F1:	H back four. F2:	One, two, three four, D. F1:	This could have been so much more succinct, this message. I mean honestly we just…so 407, 4…H back seven. F2:	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, A.

	If it's 

[00:02:08]: [inaudible] we'll cut that out. F1:	R back four. F2:	R back four. One, two, three, four, N. Old man. F1:	Old man?

	Four…U back seven. F2:	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, N. F1:	Is that your older man in…? Seven, 407…X back four. F2:	X? One, two, three, four, T.

	Unless it's a signed confession, I'm not sure it's worth it. F1:	[00:02:29]: L back seven.Part 71: F2:	[2023/05/16 17:46:00 GMT+0000] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, E. F1:	So is it going to be something like, old man in the pub, or something?

	A back four. F2:	One, two, three, four, W. F1:	And then F back seven. F2:	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, Y. F1:	Oh. F2:	Any…is it… F1:	I think anytime, maybe? F2:	Yeah, maybe some letters were a bit unclear 

[00:00:36]: [inaudible]. F1:	Anytime, wish it were just us without your old man in the way. 
F2:	Oh is that it? F1:	And then G back four?

F2:	Okay, this is going to get interesting now. We're going to get our payback now. G back four. One, two, three, four, C. 
F1:	So, C wrote this. 
F2:	Okay, C, what's his name the sheriff, the deputy. 
F3:	Chris Thompson. 
F2:	Yeah, so it's love, okay, so we've got an affair. 

[00:00:56]: [inaudible] an affair.
 F3:	Good, good, good, great, I have some things as well, okay? 
F1:	Oh good, okay, sure. Okay, share with the group. 
F3:	So here we have the emails between Cherie and Mr [Trafford?] 

[00:01:05]:, the guy from the development group. And it looks like she was talking behind Webster's back, to sell the bar. And then, so we can see here, so this is all cited, the conversation, so she was talking to, it starts here, like it's talking…'taking time to speak to me this morning, like you want to sell Old Scratch, but you should talk to me.'

[0:01:40] you should talk to me.’F2:	[2023/05/16 17:33:08 GMT+0000] And these could be numbers?

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	Oh, can you like quickly run to Duke's and bring us a beer?

F2:	[I'd better tell my husband I'm going to be here for 01:33:15] another hour.

F4:	It should be a bit less. [inaudible 01:33:22].

F3:	I'm just going to do my code for everything. It doesn't work.

F4:	Maybe have a look around, maybe there's some…

F3:	Don't give us…

F4:	I'm not saying anything, it's obvious, you've got all the stuff on the table.

F3:	Don't say anything. Oh by the way, do you see these things guys?

F1:	Oh no, not yet.

[00:00:41]: [voices overlap]

F1:	Protect Devil's Well, ritual to banish evil forces. Cannot stand idly by while despicable people create wanton destruction, 

[00:00:51]: [inaudible] protect your wild spaces. No more greedy developers, no new construction on CR66.

F3:	I think both of those things are done by the witch.

F1:	Do we know anything about the stone circle?

	So there's like this little map.

F3:	That's probably where they were doing, you can look it up on Mia's things. That's probably where the thing…

F1:	Okay. Interlopers will be banished to the bottom of Devil's Well. Oh.

F2:	[00:01:27]: [inaudible].

F3:	If it's a 666, I'm going to fucking kill myself.

F1:	What, the devil's number?

F3:	No, oh you know that six County Road, 66?

F1:	Have you tried two zero two?

F2:	I don't think that's…

F3:	Six six six. Yeah, I did, 666.

F1:	What about 812?

F3:	Yeah.

F1:	[00:01:40]: Yeah, okay. 
F2:	[2023/05/16 17:36:38 GMT+0000] I think that could be a red herring, suggesting that the person who…it was a…oh, have these had two 

[00:00:05]: [inaudible]?

F3:	But they're only three, I could try.

F2:	Don't worry. Where did we find this?

F1:	We don't know. The date you can't forget, month, month, year. Oh that'll be the combination, the date you can't forget, his anniversary.

F2:	Oh, his wedding anniversary.

F3:	Anniversary.

F2:	Yeah.

	So where did she write about she was in trouble with his wife? Oh under Cherie, yeah, it'll be in this. And he had to sleep on the sofa. Oh maybe it's the detective, maybe it was the detective who did it.

	'Once he missed their anniversary and slept in the bar for a week.' That's all, it doesn't say. It was mentioned again, wasn't it?

F1:	There's dates here, remember to pick up darling's gift, don't be late for dinner reservation tomorrow. November 12th, November 13th. 

F3:	So that would be month…

F1:	Month, month, yeah.

F3:	Ten.

F1:	Eleven.

F3:	Oh yeah. Eleven. 

F2:	And do we know what wedding anniversary it was?

F3:	I can just do…

F2:	I've got this, look this was taken from this.

F1:	Ahh.

F3:	[00:01:12]: [W, E, B, so?]

F1:	We've got it, yeah.

F2:	We cannot 

[00:01:22]: [inaudible].

F1:	Cherie Webster.

	Oh, not more of these.

F3:	Oh fuck off. Is there more of these?

F1:	Yep, 407…

F3:	Oh, is that the code?

	That's the code, move four, move zero, move seven.

	[00:01:42]: And that repeats, ooh…
Part 74: F2:	[2023/05/16 17:49:20 GMT+0000] And so, oh so it starts? 
F3:	So they start here, October 15th. 

F2:	Oh yeah. 
F1:	So yeah, so that's, he learned that she's [01:50:00] selling the bar. 
F2:	Yeah. F3:	And in his will, and what is the date of the will? 
F1:	Er… 
F3:	So we don't have the date of the will, or do we have the date of the will? That's a problem, the document. Anyways, so in the will he leaves to Joan, so to the witch, like some amount of money for her Foundation, because apparently a client of the pub killed her cat, Vinegar Tom. 
F2:	Ah…
 F1:	Oh… 
F3:	So client leaving the pub, killed her cat in a car accidentally, I think that's what happened, and that's why she hate him. 

F2:	But that's not enough to kill him. 
F3:	Exactly. Then he left some money to Donna, because, oh, some stuff to Donna… 
F2:	Oh, he's a nice guy, isn't he, I think this is 

[00:01:33]: [voices overlap] 
F3:	On no, he said… 
F1:	She shall receive free drinks at Old Scratch Tavern for the period of her natural life, or for as long as the bar remains in business, whichever is longest. 
F3:	Because she's like super-nice. And to Carmen, he left everything basically, and nothing to Cherie. 
F1:	Ooh.

F3:	[00:01:50]: So this is the inheritance…Part 75:
F2:	[2023/05/16 17:51:14 GMT+0000] Oh, and now you're asking, when did, what… 
F1:	I leave the remainder of my estate, including Old Scratch Tavern and all associated assets, plus my retirement account and the life insurance policy. 
F2:	When did he sign that? 
F1:	It doesn't say, I can't find it. 
F3:	It doesn't say. 
F1:	Oh hold on, hold on, hold on. And I execute this as my free voluntary act for the purpose of [inaudible] 

[00:00:20]: on this day, third day of December. 
F2:	So she's been doing all this shit stuff… 
F1:	So he did it after he found out?
 F3:	Yeah. 
F2:	But she doesn't necessarily know that. 
F3:	Third of December? 
F1:	Third of December. So, it makes no sense… 
F3:	And he was killed on the…so he was killed at the end of the week basically. 
F1:	So it makes no sense for Cherie to do it, because she gets nothing. 
F2:	She doesn't know though. 
F3:	But maybe she doesn't know the will, yeah. 
F1:	Ah, she might not know. 
F2:	'Cause if she did know, then that makes our Carmen the lead suspect now.

F3:	[00:00:58]: So what is the…Part 76: 
F2: 	[2023/05/16 17:52:15 GMT+0000] 'Cause she didn't want to sell, she would have kept the bar going, yeah, going forward. 
F3:	Hold on. So should she fail to survive me, or for any reason refuses bequest, I then advise for the remainder of this estate to her sister, Christina Eleanor Rohas, as the secondary 

[00:00:08]: [inaudible]. 

F2:	So it's pretty conclusive that the wife has lost the bar. 

F3:	Okay, but she didn't know?

[00:00:13]: [voices overlap] 
F1:	…stupid codes. 
F3:	So what was with the codes? 
F1:	So one we did, this is an envelope to Cherie Webster, and it says, 'Any time, wish it were just us without your older man in the way. C.' 
F3:	Sorry, again? 
F1:	'Anytime, wish it were just us without your older man in the way. C.' 

F3:	Oh it's clear, this is a letter from Thompson to Cherie, Chris, and that is the letter from Cherie to Chris, so okay. 
F1:	Which letter was from Cherie to Chris? Oh this one, right, that we haven't deciphered. 
F3:	Look guys, I think Suzanne in the beginning, inheritance and affair. 
F2:	Mmm. Here's an interesting one. I think, if we think it's an affair, we think it's this, the deputy…
 F1:	Let me work out this one. 
F2:	…but if he gave actual notice of warning, of a timing, I think this one we can believe. 
F3:	So this one is the one where, yeah, [voices overlap] 

[00:01:14]: Donna.Part 77: 
F2:	[2023/05/16 17:53:30 GMT+0000] I think we can believe this, 'cause it was a real car.

	It was a real car, the other ones I don't think we can believe, 'cause there's no evidence, he could have just written them down. 

F3:	So the Donna's one, yeah, and then, so this is the, I mean the early ones we can also believe, right? But the collision between the blue and the silver car at four, we don't know about? 

F2:	Yeah, there's no evidence for that one. 

F3:	No. So the things before, that's fine, [inaudible] 

[00:00:22]: on here. 
F2:	Is there anything, we've got a clue which we haven't worked out? 
F1:	There's… 
F3:	Also because at 3.30, the bar-keep was still in the bar, so at 3.31 Chris could have been doing whatever, it's fine. 
F2:	I'd say with his boot, 'cause this is Chris's boot, these aren't work boots, he would have changed them, he must have had his car, to have changed his boots on the night, or [inaudible]

[00:00:49]:, 'cause he didn't wear his police boots. 
F3:	Okay, so like a quick question? Do we think it's Donna? 
F2:	Or why do we think…? 
F3:	Or wait, no, do we think it's Joan. Do we think it's the witch? 
F1:	No. 
F2:	No, you wouldn't kill for losing a cat, and it wasn't even him that killed the cat. 
F1:	Like, I think the weird stuff was her getting revenge for the cat, but 

[00:01:04]: I don't think it's related to the murder.Part 78: 
F2:	[2023/05/16 17:54:39 GMT+0000] And I think they used her wackiness to intimidate him, and then think it was her, and it was them. 

F1:	I don't think she was the devil, though, like I think someone else was trying to make it seem like he was going crazy.
 F2:	No, I think someone else was, yeah, I agree. I agree. 
F3:	So what about the Donna though? 
F2:	Well Donna left this, with… 
F3:	Yeah, what did she say? 
F2:	Well, with this Wednesday about land, Devil's Well. Oh, maybe he was asking her? She wasn't the people selling it, because it was another company outside, of course it was, 'cause they were doing it secretly. So he might have gone to her for some help and advice? 

F1:	Maybe she found out, because she's a Real Estate agent, maybe she found out there was someone selling it, and wanted to tell him? 
F2:	Said, phone me, and we'll talk about it. So, at the moment, she still looks like an ally, rather than, I thought an Estate Agent was a baddy, but I'm not sure… 
F3:	Yeah, not that I'm quite sure of, but I don't see the reason for 

[00:00:25]: her to be…Part 79: 
F2:	[2023/05/16 17:55:07 GMT+0000] And then he had, oh, I know, the shoe, the boot, with the picture, if it was a baddy, we know he had that, 'cause she gave it to him that night, he's dropped it when he attacked her. So we know that boot was, that I think says, that he was with her. 
F3:	So you mean that… 
F2:	They must have been together. 
F3:	The bar-keep had this? 
F2:	The murder person had this, and we know this is the chap's foot, so it means they were together at some point. 
F1:	Why would the murder person have that? 
F2:	Well maybe he was strangling him, and it fell out of the pocket. 
F3:	No, I'm confused about this. 
F1:	No, but the murdered guy never got that? 
F3:	Didn't she leave a message for him when she left out of the bar, who did she give it to, when she 

[00:01:12]: [came?]? 
F1:	It said, he never saw it, because it was never handed to him. 
F2:	Mmm. 
F3:	So Donna wanted to see him. 
F2	Didn't she hand this to him? 
F1:	F2:	I thought…

F3:	Hold on, 

[00:01:32]: She left it at the bar, but then, it seems like Carmen didn't pass it on. where are all these people?Part 80: 
Female 2:	[2023/05/16 17:56:44 GMT+0000] 'Cause there is a possibility where Carmen got him to change the will and has benefitted? 
Female 1:	'…left a note on her menu, and a matchbox on the counter for Nick, but he never got the chance to see it,' it says. 
Female 3:	So why is there another matchbox in the photo? Female 2:	I mean, it could be another matchbox, it could genuinely be another matchbox, but if she's got it, everybody could have had them, so that's not really, you can't pin someone on it. 
Female 3:	I'm confused about the matchbox.

	So Donna doesn't have an alibi, but she also doesn't have motive. Female 1:	It's just weird that she was in the car, that way. 
Female 3:	Chris T has a motive, by the means of Cherie, because if he is in an affair with Cherie, then he'd want to help her, and he has the means. He was in that area. 
Female 1:	[00:00:50]: [inaudible] 
Female 2:	[00:00:55]: So, we've discounted the witch, and we've still got three of them. 

Female 3:	So the thing with Donna, we just don't know. 
Female 2:	I don't think the detective has any reason. He hasn't got a motive has he?

Female 3:	No, but he is dating Cherie, right…?

Female 2:	Yeah, so he can only be an accomplice at best. Female 3:	Yes, oh well, no, but he could have done that for her, 

[00:01:19]: because…F2: [2023/05/16 17:58:04 GMT+0000] Then there'd be two of them, that's what I'm saying.

F3: Can we say two people Ella, by the rules of the game, or is it only one person?

F4: It's up to you.

F3: Okay. So I think if somebody killed the guy, it's probably going to be another guy, right, like he's stronger?

F2: Well, I think…no, why would he go and talk to someone on a ledge at the top of a…why was he up there?

F1: Yeah, weird.

F2: He could have been chasing the witch. The witch takes his mask off and pushes him over the ledge.

F1: Is he chasing someone in a devil mask or…when did he run out again?

F2: Well, that's why he ran into the forest, but that was 3.30. Oh…

F3: [00:00:30]: [voices overlap]…

F2: …could it have been the deputy turns up at 3.30 and then does all the spooky things 

[00:00:35]: [inaudible].

F1: Well the deputy stopped Donna's car at 3.31 and…

F3: At 3.31.

F1: …that was by the bar, right?

F3: Yeah.

F1: So he was near.

F2: Mmm.

F3: Yeah. I honestly don't think, like it's not Joan definitely, because she was with Mia for the most of it, so this is the time of death, and this is when Mia's last comments, when Mia came back, and that's probably the time where she was going back. 

[00:01:16]: So, there's no thing for Joan.F2: [2023/05/16 17:59:25 GMT+0000] Can I just, 'cause I'm out of the loop, what was this about, just to prove the cat story? What did this bring us?

F3: So this is the time when Donna started the meeting, for example, you know? Not Donna, Joan, sorry, started the meeting.

F2: This tells you when the protest was on.

F1: The witch, yeah.

F2: And so that gives her an alibi, 'cause she had a woman there at 3.30, and he was killed in that window. Okay. So this is an alibi for Donna really?

F3: Yeah. Joan, Joan, Joan, it's Joan.

F2: Joan, yeah.

F3: Donna doesn't have an alibi, she was there at 3.30 and Chris was there at 3.30. Cherie, apparently was with her friend, so she apparently has an alibi. 

F2: I can't see Donna's motive.

F1: Neither can I, did we miss something?

F3: He liked Donna.

F1: Yeah, I don't see Donna's motive, other than the inheritance thing, but it's not clear that she knew about it. 

F3: It was just for drinks.

F1: Oh, yeah, of course, it 

[00:00:35]: was just drinks for Donna, it was Carmen.

F3: Do you want to pick a suspect, just from the list of suspects, or going to say it's Carmen?

F4: [00:00:45]: Up to you.Part 84:

F1:	[2023/05/16 18:01:16 GMT+0000] Yeah, yeah. 

F2:	Yeah, it was a silver…

F1:	So, silly question, but a Cadillac, what is that, could that be a nickname for something or not?

F2:	No, it's a type of car.

F3:	Yeah, it's not a Mercedes.

F1:	It's a type, no.

F3:	No.

F2:	So Donna has the Lincoln convertible, silver. Blue Volkswagen Beetle is Joan. And he had a Toyota Prius. 

F3:	Wait, wait, but he said collision, blue and black, but blue is a different blue, right yeah, it's a different blue car?

F2:	That was given a name. The blue car was a…

F3:	Cadillac as well, or something, yeah.

F2:	Yeah, this is only a Volkswagen Beetle here. 

F1:	Also, the date of 13.05, the officer told Cherie about his death, so like, maybe that's proof that she wasn't at her friend's house, I don't know.

F3:	But why, no, she could have been, that's why he told her so late, right?

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	'…but I assured her,' did we like figure out the last letter?

F1:	No.

F2:	Do we know what year this happened?

F1:	No.

F2:	It's strange isn't it?

F1:	What year was it that opened, the thing, this. When we had to put a month and year.

F2:	Oh, it was their wedding.

F3:	Oh…

F1:	Four, 2004?

F2:	Oh no, I wondered when…2004?

F3:	Oh, Webster's 2004. Oh, that's from their wedding. Oh that's so we could figure out the thingy. 

F1:	[00:01:07]: Ah.F1: [2023/05/16 18:00:13 GMT+0000] I don't think it's Carmen.

F2: No, because intimidation's been happening, although you could put the intimidation to the witch's anyway, because they heard about the sale, and didn't realise it was him, and thought it was his wife. So the witch's spooky bit, could still be a misunderstanding, 'cause they heard about the sale and thought it was his fault.

 Are we missing any evidence? What's the…everything here will be a clue. What's Webster's, why have we got that, what's Webster's to do with?

F3: That's the name. Nick Webster, that's his name, right? That's when the bar opened, I guess, that's when they bought it I guess, maybe?

 So okay, we're assuming we trust Cherie's alibi, she couldn't kill, and there's nothing placing her at the place, of the location of the murder, right?

F1: Cherie, well she said she was at a friend's house, but I've not seen any evidence that would confirm that. So, I think we need to say we don't know where she was.

F3: But, was there evidence saying that she was at the area? Also, not.

F1: Also no.

F3: So she's like a big blob of nothing?

F1: I don't think so, unless she was involved in one of the car accidents?

F3: What's her car?

F2: Silver Mercedes Benz, are we talking about…

F3: Honda…no, there's no Mercedes Benz.

F2: [00:00:57]: Were you talking about Cherie.F3:	[2023/05/16 18:02:24 GMT+0000] And I just did it like zero, one, two, three, four, and make that four.

F1:	Two thousand and four, so that was to figure out the year of their wedding.

F2:	Okay.

F1:	So that was to…

F3:	Figure out the date.

F2:	Okay. So I think, that's what I'm trying to think, where's a clue it hasn't…?

F3:	So should I maybe figure out this last bit, because that's the only bit that's that's missing.

	Oh, what's this photo for?

F1:	So I think it's to figure out boots, and I think it's probably these ones, and so far all we've figured out from it, is that there's men's boots and there's women's boots. But I don't know where this picture was taken, but number two, maybe we figure out an address?

F3:	So I think, those could be Joan's boots like outside of her porch, right, because…

F2:	They look like women's boots to me.

F1:	Yeah, they are women's, I think they're these ones which are, I don't know, one of these.

F3:	I think it's Joan. I think it belongs to Joan, I think it's her porch or something.

F2:	Oh…

F1:	Do we…can we check address, do these have addresses?

F2:	I was thinking, on her notes, did she say she took something, she took two things from someone's house, but she took something else from someone else's house.

F2:	[00:01:29]: [inaudible] doesn't look that promising, we're still waiting for the 

[00:01:30]: results…’
Part 86:

F1:	[2023/05/16 18:03:57 GMT+0000] [inaudible] tracker, so that's this thing.

F2:	Okay.

F1:	But I…

F2:	So it could be, 'I took a picture,' this is a picture. So this is picture one.

F3:	Hi there, a lot of space, sitting nervously.

F2:	But maybe that's to disprove it's her. Maybe it's to prove it wasn't her boot and it was his boot. So it proves that it's not her.

F1:	Yeah, maybe it was to say it couldn't be her boots.

F2:	Yeah.

F3:	I think it's just not Joan, I think it's…

F2:	So I think it's to disprove, it wasn't her boots that were there.

F1:	These are men's boots, right? So…

F2:	Do we know where we got this picture from?

F3:	So how do we do this code?

F1:	Let me just look through this again. 

F2:	So I think he went and changed his [inaudible] 

[00:00:53]: and then he was going to talk to her about the…I can't see that we've got any more clues.

F1:	Silver Lincoln?

F3:	Yeah, that's Donna.

F1:	Donna.

F3:	And it just confirms that he actually gave the ticket…

F2:	So who, oh so she was nicked on a road at a certain time when the murder happened, so it couldn't have been…

F3:	Three thirty-one.

F2:	…she wasn't at the pub, scaring him through the window, 

[00:01:21]: he couldn't have chased her…Part 87:


F3:	[2023/05/16 18:05:20 GMT+0000] And Chris also couldn't have been, because he was also giving away the ticket.

F2:	Yes.

F3:	So Chris and…

F2:	So it's back to Cherie, all by herself.

F3:	Yeah, or [inaudible] 

[00:00:11]: like, yeah.

F2:	She was at someone's house, overnight, a friend's house that night, she's got no alibi.

F3:	Well, let's do this one, this is the last piece of, bit of…

F1:	Why was she killing, to sell the pub and run off with Chris?

F3:	Yeah.

F2:	Well, yeah, but she might not have, Chris is a police officer, she might not have told him that bit. He dies, she's made it all spooky, and he'll marry her thinking she's not a murderer.

F1:	Yeah. She could not be involved. This…I don't know.

F3:	Oh wait, it's not the same thing as that one?

F1:	It wasn't making sense. 

[00:00:42]: [voices overlap].

F1:	How were you doing the letters Suzanne? So if you go…

F2:	Well, I did it like this, and then I was just counting.

F1:	So 407, 407, right, back from four D.

F2:	How many would you go back?

F1:	So if we were doing four, the same pattern as before?

F2:	One, two, three, so that will be a Z.

F1:	Yeah, and then…

F3:	Oh.

F2:	Another D would…

F1:	D and then O, seven back from O.

F2:	Seven back from O?

F1:	[00:01:15]: Yeah.
Part 88:

F2:	[2023/05/16 18:06:36 GMT+0000] Oh, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, H.

F1:	Yeah, like this doesn't make any sense.

F3:	Have you tried the other direction, forward?

	Four forward?

F1:	Or it could start with seven O four or something. 'Cause I think so far they've all been in one direction.

F2:	Did you write that on there, did you write that?

F3:	No.

F1:	No, no, this was on here, which is where we got this from.

F3:	Yeah.

F1:	Well let's try seven back from D.

	Could you…?

F2:	Oh sorry. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, W. Or that could be a Y.

F3:	Guess.

F2:	Y's W and what's H, how many back from…?

F1:	Seven, four back from D.

F2:	One, two, three, four, oh back to a Z.

F1:	Zero doesn't make sense either, 'cause that would be D.

F2:	So this is the only clue we haven't solved.

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	I think it's Chris who killed him. I mean, I think he's like the most straightforward and most obvious. Chris killed him and then because Cherie asked him.

F2:	So here's a question. So, if we think that, maybe the clue's in the F. So maybe if it's F…

F1:	Oh, we know F is, if it was from Cherie, it'll be a C.

F3:	Oooh.

F2:	If this is from…

F1:	Because they're letters they wrote to each other, right?

F3:	[00:01:00]: Yeah.
Part 90:

F2:	[2023/05/16 18:10:13 GMT+0000] How many back from W?

F1:	Seven.

F2:	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

F1:	Sorry no, D, seven back from D, which should give W.

F2:	Yeah, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, yeah, W.

F1:	And then, D…and then four back from O.

F2:	Four back from O? One, two, three, four, K.

F1:	That's weird.

F3:	Oh could have Donna put connections?

F1:	Seven back from U.

F2:	Seven back from U. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, N.

F3:	So like connect the…Cherie and the…

F1:	This makes no sense. Did you do four for all of them.

F3:	…[inaudible] 

[00:00:21]: guy.

F2:	Oh no, I just wondered if I did a direct transpose to see if that transferred across.

F3:	'Cause Joan doesn't fit anything.

F1:	Yeah, but it didn't?

F2:	No, it didn't make any sense at all.

F3:	Donna doesn't fit anything, so I'm thinking, did she maybe, somehow connect with Cherie and the buying people?

	Because otherwise, Donna doesn't fit at all. But maybe she helped Cherie.

F1:	I just think that we can exclude Donna.

F3:	So she might have not killed, but I don't know, she might have known something.

F2:	I think Donna, 'cause she was nicked in the car, is off. 

F3:	I think she just knew something.

F2:	Isn't it Donna who got nicked?

F1:	[00:00:47]: Yeah.
Part 91:

F2:	[2023/05/16 18:11:01 GMT+0000] So I think that's enough of an alibi. In fact, funnily enough, it covers her and the policeman, unless of course, they're [inaudible 02:11:17]?

F1:	I think it's Cherie. I think it's the wife.

F2:	Because she has got the…if you went back on motive, who else has got a motive? No one else has got a motive, so it's her.

F3:	Well no, but Chris, Chris's motive is related to her motive.

F2:	I agree he could be an assistant, but he hasn't got a motive in his own right.

F3:	No, but it doesn't mean she's not [voices overlap] 

[00:00:35]:, I mean, like…

F1:	So that she doesn't need to leave him, but…?

F3:	He likes her, and that's a motive.

F2:	I'm not saying, he isn't the orchestrator, he might be an accomplice, I'm not denying him as an accomplice, but…

F3:	Oh yeah, he might not be the orchestrator, yeah, but…

F2:	Yeah, he couldn't have done it on his own, he's got no point of doing it on his own.

F3:	But he could have killed him, or he could have also done, yeah, but he could have killed him, he could have 

[00:00:53]: voices overlap.

F1: [0:01:08]: I think to do it on his own, it would have been hard, because he was working, he couldn't have been the devil mask to like get him to run into [18:12:09]: the forest.Part 92:

F2:	[2023/05/16 18:12:12 GMT+0000] And how much of his, I mean, she did well to nick this notebook. I mean, he's got a pretty thorough…where's his gaps?

F3:	He could have like, faked it, right?

F2:	True, but where are the fakey ones, you know, which ones…

F3: 	Er, collision between the blue and black car, 'cause those are like random cars we don't know.

F2:	I agree, that's the only one.

F3:	But the thing is, the orange advertisement…

F2:	But the collision between the blue and the black car, he did book the driver, so that would have been in the records.

F3:	Mmm, okay. Yeah, so then he didn't kill, so…

F2:	He was driving, so…I think, that yeah, he's got an alibi over the period.

F3:	Well he could have killed, no, no, no, so like that just means that he didn't kill anyone at 04:01, he could have killed the guy between 30:30 and 04:01, like it's everything very close. He could have totally done that. So I think the murder happened between 03:30 and 04:01. 

	So the collision between blue and black car, 04:01, 03:30 CCTV camera, 03:31 Chris is at the location stopping Donna. So between 03:30 and 04:01…

F2:	I agree, that's his only window, he's got coverage. Interestingly, he was at…traffic stopped silver Lincoln, tail lights out, he was actually at the pub at the…I mean, he was at the pub at this time, so 

[00:01:23]: he could have done the scary bit.
F3:	[2023/05/16 18:13:44 GMT+0000] No, but I think he was writing this, right, the 331?

F2:	Oh yeah, yeah. So he wasn't the devil, who's the devil then, in this picture?

F1:	That could have been Cherie to get him to run off into the woods.

F2:	And that he followed?

F1:	Because, the spooky witch woman was busy doing some sort of chanting in the forest. Using the technical terms.

F3:	I think Donna is in on this. I think Donna's in on this. 

F1:	Why?

F3:	Because the thing is, she is a Real Estate person, somebody needed to put, so connect Cherie and the people buying things. Donna's the one who could have done that. Donna left the bar one hour before the closing time, and we suppose the closing time is somewhere around 03:30, because they talked about 03:30, that was the closing time, that's what Carmen said. And Donna left at 02:30, as we said, supposedly, but she was there at 03:31, so she might have been there to create an alibi for Chris. She was there to create an alibi for Chris, and maybe they wanted, all three, to sell it, and then to split the money.

	What doesn't explain it, the fact that why was she like nervous, and she wanted to meet with him. Maybe she decided not to do that, maybe she changed her mind. So, what was the note again?

	Because that would make sense, like then they make the alibi, Cherie's the one, the devil, 

[00:01:13]: while…
Part 94:

F2:	[2023/05/16 18:14:58 GMT+0000] Do we know who's her company?

F3:	What?

F2:	Building Bright Futures, that's never been mentioned has it? 

[00:00:22]: [inaudible].

F3:	Maybe in the article, maybe the other side of the article.

F2:	Yeah, I just wondered, I don't think I've written it down, I just wondered who she worked for.

F3:	'About land, Wednesday, Devil's Well, 11pm.' Oh no, but then she wouldn't have left a note, [fact?] 

[00:00:33]:, she wouldn't have left a note to meet him in the future, right, because she knew they were going to kill him? Oh shit, okay, my alibi isn't working anymore. Not alibi, my idea isn't working anymore.

	'About land'? 

F1:	I was just trying to find a link between her real estate company, and the one buying this, but I can't figure 

[00:00:50]: [anything else here?].

F3:	Yeah, no but then she would have…

F1:	Because she works for, I don't know, it says…

F2:	Let's say she was trying to sell the land to him, there was no incentive for her to kill someone, if she was going to find some…she was talking to the husband, not the wife 

[00:01:07]: [inaudible].

F3:	'Wednesday, Devil's Well, about land, 11pm.'

F1:	It might just be that she found out through the grapevine and…

F2:	Oh, she does say something odd. So she's crying a lot. 'We talked afterwards, just reminiscing, and then she said something really odd like, if only I'd been faster, maybe I could have made a difference.' So maybe whatever they were talking about here, could have made a difference. 

[00:01:43]: So I think she was helping him.
Part 95:

F1:	[2023/05/16 18:16:48 GMT+0000] Yeah, I don't think, I think it's fine. Who do you think it is? F3:	So the thing is, something weird about the Donna, she was there. She was there one hour later, like after she left the bar. Right? F1:	Yeah. F3:	Can I get the letter? No, the letter from… F2:	Just to go back to Donna, the night Nick died, she said, she was…'Having a rough time that night, was preoccupied with some work problems, and then I decided to go for a drive to try and clear my thoughts, but it only got worse for me.' That's probably why she got nicked. F3:	What is it…doesn't… F2:	Then she says, 'When I asked her about the stuff at the bar, she got really [antsy?] 

[18:17:19], and said, we shouldn't talk here, and hustled me out of the house in a hurry.'

	So I think she was trying to help him and she legitimately, admits she was on the road, and legitimately got nicked. F3:	She said she went out for a drive, right, after the bar? Okay. F2:	Yeah, because she was feeling anxious. F3:	Okay, and then she went back? F2:	But I think she's… F1:	It might have just been on her way home though, or like 

[00:00:42]: she might have just been driving past it.F2:	[2023/05/16 18:17:35 GMT+0000] I think the police officer gives her an alibi.

F3:	Yeah, okay, the police officer gives her an alibi, and she…

F2:	And she's quite anxious and says, we shouldn't talk here, so she knows something's afoot and dangerous. I think she's on his side, because of what's said here.

F3:	Okay.

F1:	And if we're saying…

F2:	Oh, unless it's…

F1:	…the police officer gives her an alibi, then she gives the police officer an alibi, and that's him way right, so I still think Cherie.

F2:	And we know it's not the cat woman, the…yeah.

	Here's an interesting one, which I think is meant to make us think.

	'Called her office, and they said she'd left on a business trip, not sure when she's supposed to get back.'

	So this gives the hint that she's run away from something, but she might actually just be running away 'cause she's scared. 

F1:	Yeah. Can I see Cherie again?

F3:	I think it's Chris guy killed. I think this is the most obvious, and the most straightforward thing. Chris killed Nick Webster, because he has an affair with Nick Webster's wife, and because Nick Webster's wife wants to sell the property.

F2:	But I can't see his motive.

F3:	Because he wants to fuck that pussy.

F4:	That's great in a transcript by the way.

F3:	[00:01:10]: I know, you're welcome.
Part 97: 
F2:	[2023/05/16 18:18:49 GMT+0000] He was having this affair without…I mean, it was 'cause she was around, but it was carrying on whether [inaudible] 

[00:00:14]: long game. 
F3:	Men do crazy shit, if they are, and people do crazy shit, if they have the right motivation, just that's the motivation for men. 
F1:	It's annoying that we don't have the letter he wrote to her. 
F3:	You're welcome. 
F2:	It's annoying we can't [have the?] 

[00:00:29]: stupid envelope. 
F3:	Sorry.
 F1:	The other envelope had the code on it, so why does this one not? 
F2:	Oh, I'm just going to ask the invigilator, if we had been allowed to read the book, would it help us solve that clue? 

[00:00:43]: [inaudible]. 
F4:	No.

F2:	Okay.

F1:	Is your [meanness?] 

[00:00:48]: getting in the way. 
F2:	Okay, [voices overlap] 

[00:00:55]: called it out if it had, so I was just trying… 
F3:	Do you guys think it's just Cherie who killed and Chris is innocent? 
F2:	Well, I think there's two people in the murder, you could make a much better alibi in all of that. I don't know. Let's see the timeline [2:20:00] of what happens. He couldn't have been the devil in the shot because he's nicking someone, so it's her. She runs into the forest and he follows. They hear some, the witches… 
F1:	But how would he know, because if he followed from the ticket, then Donna would have seen too, right, if they were together?

F3:	[00:01:31]: Yeah, they…Part 98:

F2:	[2023/05/16 18:20:22 GMT+0000] So with the ticket? No, I'm saying that the murdered guy follows his wife into the forest, and the witch and the witch's friends hear some stumbling and a fight, but doesn't hear anything, at about, I don't know, what was it three o'clock, something? So that's them running into the forest. She might then have met him and said, 'oh let's go and have a look at the waterfall, for old time's sake, for romance,' and she went up…why did he go up to the waterfall when he's had all this threats that someone's going to be thrown down. I think he went with his wife.

F3:	No, but the wife was the devil.

F2:	Ah, but she's changed now, she's [inaudible]

[00:00:36]:, it was only a little mask. 

F3:	But then he's like, why?

F2:	He finds his wife.

F3:	Why are you there, right?

F2:	Why's he at the top of…well maybe, let's say he followed the devil all the way up to the waterfall.

F3:	Yeah. And Chris followed after them. Chris finished with the ticket, and then Chris followed after them, and then the devil kind of disappeared in the woods, and Chris hit Webster with something heavy and he fell.

F1:	But then where's Cherie in all of this?

F3:	Cherie is the devil, and she ran away, she just lured…

F1:	So you're agreeing that she is involved, it's just it's also Chris?

F3:	Yeah, so I think I go with Suzanne, I think Suzanne is right, Cherie lured Webster in the forest, 

[00:01:10]: I just think she's not the one who pushed him. 
F2:	[2023/05/16 18:21:38 GMT+0000] Now, that's interesting me, because they said they never investigated the top. So if we knew that that footprint was from the top with a match, or it would associate with someone in the pub, we knew the deputy never looked at the top, well they sort of hinted at it. If we knew somehow, if we knew this was from the top, we would say that the police officer was up there, and he's an accomplice.

F3:	Yeah, so I would, yeah, I still think…the only weird thing is the matches…

F1:	Does it say anything about? No, 'cause this is after the…

F3:	…from the bar

F2:	Well, if he'd pushed him over, I mean, the chap could have dropped it. I think the barman's dropped it, I don't think he…

	So it's a weak one, but I think, if we knew where this was…

F3:	I would agree with you, yeah, and then…

F1:	'Cause if it was at the bottom, if he would have investigated it, and he would have seen of course, his footprint might be there.

	But, have we missed something?

F3:	So I think, yeah, I don't know…

	[00:00:48]: Camilla, what do you think?
104:

F1:	[2023/05/16 18:30:31 GMT+0000] One from B.

F2:	One from…A.

F1:	One from H.

F2:	H…G.

F1	Three from D.

F3:	Again. 

F1:	Yeah, I think it will be.

F2:	Three from D. A.

F1:	One from J.

F2:	One from J. I.

F1:	And three from O. F2:	Three from O. L. One, two, three, L. 

	Is that the signature, the person who signed off? F1:	No. F2:	Okay. F3:	It's 

[00:00:01]: [inaudible].

F1:	And a one from O, was there was meant to be one.

F2:	One from O, N.

F1:	Oh yeah.

F2:	And then three from F.

F1:	Three from F. C. F2:	C. Can't wait to see you, mind if I borrow the car again? F2:	So he's borrowed his car, so she's got…? F3:	No, Cherie got the car, right?

	Because there's two Chris. F1:	There's two Chris, yeah, Cherie. F2:	So they both put C, that's annoying. So Cherie is, who's borrowed who's car? F3:	She borrowed Chris's car. F2:	So Chris's car is a Toyota Prius 2018. It doesn't say what colour it is. F3:	But, it doesn't matter, then if she borrowed his car, she might have… F2:	Got his boots. Oh, if she's borrowed his car, 

[00:00:32]: it's not his…Part 105:F3:	[2023/05/16 18:31:06 GMT+0000] She might have driven back to the place, right? If she borrowed the car, that means she wanted to have the car for like, a reason, right? So she might have driven back. 
F2:	Well [inaudible] 

[00:00:20]: if she had the car, he couldn't have had his boots on. So that is her. 

F3:	Ooh. 
F1:	Yeah. 
F2:	So he didn't have the boots that night, if she's got, oh when's the date on this? 
F3:	No wait, I mean, he could have added the boots later. There's no date. He could have added the boots in the car later, right, you know what I mean, when the photo was taken? 
F2:	So what's the significance of her borrowing the car? 
F3:	So it's a Toyota Prius. It doesn't say the colour. Collision? 
F1:	Personal. Yeah, so he had his official vehicle probably, the Dodge, and then he had this. 
F3:	Yeah. 
F2:	Registration. 
F3:	So this kind of indicates that she might have wanted to go back to, like she was staying with her friends, but she didn't really stay the whole night. 
F2:	Oh yeah, has she got a car? 
F3:	[00:01:01]: [inaudible]. 
F1:	He replied, yes, right, he said, 'Anytime.' 
F2:	Oh yeah, so her silver Mercedes, maybe she's trying to get him nicked rather than her, maybe, she's a clever woman, they said she's quite cool and calculating.
 F3:	So what was… 
F2:	I think she wanted to get out of the small town. I think she…she's polished, and I think she was taking everybody for a ride. I think once she got that think sold, she [inaudible] 

[00:01:29]: Mercedes…F1:	[2023/05/16 18:32:37 GMT+0000] What are you looking for?

F3:	What did he say.

F1:	'Anytime, I wish it were just us without your old man in the way.'

F3:	Ah, aha, okay. Yeah. So I kind of think he didn't kill anyone. It kind of changes my mind. But then I agree with what Suzanne is saying. 

F1:	I don't think this is enough of an alibi to say that she actually did go away.

F2:	No, I think her alibi is, she has no alibi.

F3:	Yeah.

F1:	Yeah. Okay so she had the opportunity, because she's got no alibi.

F2:	She does ballet classes, she's quite fit. She's a gym person, she's quite fit.

F3:	Had a car. What's…

F2:	She's a gym person, she's quite fit, she can run a lot.

F3:	Aha…so…

F2:	She's a perfectionist. I think if she's a perfectionist she would not trust her sloppy boyfriend in a murder, I think she did it all herself. And she did study ballet in Indianapolis when she was 14.

F3:	This is good, I like what you're saying. 

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	So what was her car, her car was a silver Mercedes Benz, but that doesn't matter, and she borrowed the Toyota?

F2:	She definitely has no plans to re-open Old Scratch, so she made that clear.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	So she feels, ah, she still thinks she owns it. At the funeral she said she has no plans to reopen it, so she thinks she still owns it.

F3:	[00:01:12]: Aha.
Part 107:

F2:	[2023/05/16 18:33:52 GMT+0000] 'I don't know how I could bear it, not when there's a memory of poor Nick around every corner.' So she thinks she's still, she doesn't know about the will. And she was just staying at friends. I don't think our lass believes the staying with friends, 'cause she puts it in inverted commas. 

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	'And when I brought up the possibility of foul play, she absolutely refused to consider it.' Well, you think a wife would have said, oh, I want to know what's happened to my husband. It's almost like an insurance policy coming through story isn't it?

	And she said, 'Nick has been behaving so strangely, seeing things that weren't there, drinking too much'. Now, he hasn't been drinking, she's the one that also puts the, drinking too much, and he wasn't, it was only a minor bit of [inaudible] 

[00:02:02]:. 'I'm sure he didn't even realise what he was doing.'

F1:	It seems like it could have been here doing it.

F2:	She's made him look a bit flaky.

F1:	Yeah. She did all this to make him less believable and then killed him.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	Well, are we in agreement?

F3:	Wait a second, so she fit, [inaudible] 

[00:02:29]: who could run far.

F1:	Yeah. She tried to ruin like, his…

F3:	Credibility.

F1:	[00:02:31]: Yes, that's the word.F2:	[2023/05/16 18:35:12 GMT+0000] And I think that…well we don't know when she took the car, but I think if it's meant to be a clue… She sent…she kept sending him notes, so they had a [clandestine?] 

[18:35:22]: relationship. That's the only thing we've proved, none of the notes said, 'oh, we must run away tonight,' which is what I thought he was going to say.

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	So this is 

[18:35:31]: [mean?] 

F1:	Do you even want to know how long we've been at this?

F2:	Five minutes? Tell us…

F4:	You don't want to know.

F1:	It's, I checked, I know,

F3:	Almost three hours. 

	And then borrowed the car? Nobody…

F2:	All we could have saved is a stupid clue, back and forwards, that's the only thing we've done, that has been a waste of time.

F1:	I know, I think we've spent at least an hour on the stupid codes.

F2:	I think those codes, I would like to have my life back on that really, but I think the rest was legit, we couldn't have done it any quicker, we wrote them all slowly, we did it thoroughly.

F3:	I don't care, I mean it's fine.

F2:	Well, we could have done it quicker, if we split up jobs, but then you've got to keep the data together, so then we could have done it.

F3:	No, yeah, exactly. So, she's got the motive, right? She has the means. And she already did some things beforehand, like trying to ruin her husband's credibility. 

[00:01:00]: She borrowed a car for some reason.
Part 109: 
F2:	[2023/05/16 18:36:15 GMT+0000] Yeah, we don't really know from the envelope, what time of day it is, but it's a clue, so we'll go with it. 
F3:	Nobody to support her alibi, that's opportunity. And she's fit, so she could run, and make her husband follow her. 
F1:	Yeah. 
F2:	And the other chap was working that night, he was pretty busy really, the boyfriend. 
F1:	Yeah. 
F3:	Okay, give us the envelope, we're done. 
F4:	Okay, so is that your final answer? 
F3:	Okay, so we're saying Chris is not involved. 
F2:	I think so. I think she's going to just, I don't think she's happy in that small town, she could have wiped her husband off, and is buggering off somewhere else.
 F3:	Okay. 
F1:	Yeah.
 F4:	Okay. 
F1:	That looks satisfying, do we not get to do it? 
F2:	I'm going to cry if we're wrong. 
F3:	[00:01:05]: [inaudible] 
F1:	I think we've earned it.
F3:	We need to take like a photograph. 
F2:	Oh nice, you're going to let…you should open it, because breaking that code on the envelope was inspiring. 
F1:	Ready. 
F2:	Oh yeah, that's right, we need a photograph, or it depends if it's right. Or at least… 
F4:	You'll need to read it out. 
F2:	Oh. 
F1:	Yeah, do I read this first? 
F3:	Yes. F4:	[00:01:40]: No, the paper.F1:	[2023/05/16 18:22:42 GMT+0000] I mean, I'm annoyed about the stupid code and envelope and I don't like it. And yeah, this is weird. I was just trying to see if it says anything in here, because, she took photos right, and it says, where was it? 'On my way out I took a peak in his car, I noticed something that might be useful? So I don't know if she means the boots, or if there's something else.

F2: 	Well, I did like that question that you asked earlier, but I couldn't answer it.

F1:	Well, if it's not the boots, then I don't know what else it would be.

	I don't know.

F2:	The only thing, and it doesn't [mean anything?] 

[00:00:36]:, he said at one point, he followed him. But that might just 'cause he thought it was a man. 

F1:	It might be trying to put us off.

F2:	Yeah. 

F1:	Is she tall?

F2:	'I can see the devil in the woods, I'm just not fast enough to catch him.' So there is a suggestion that he thought that it was a man, but how tall is his wife?

F1:	Five foot seven.

F2:	Oh yeah.

F3:	Well, that's basically

[00:00:57]: [man height?].

F1:	I mean, that's not too short.

F3:	No, it's basically my height. I was the devil.

F4:	Is that a confession? Actually…

F1:	That's it, solved it. 

F4:	We can do that 

[00:01:12]: [inaudible] jumping out of the window.

F3:	[00:01:16]: [inaudible].

F1:	[00:01:18]: Oh my God.
F1: [2023/05/16 18:37:58 GMT+0000]: The paper, okay. Right, Webster's death, a murder suspect arrested. Are you ready? The death of Old Scratch Tavern owner, Nicholas Webster has been reclassified as a murder, according to official paperwork filed this week. Webster's December 7th death, was initially ruled an accident. The case was recently reopened, as a homicide. Sheriff Paul McGinty confirmed a suspected is now in custody in connection with Webster's death. Cherie Webster, the victim's widow, has been charged with the murder of her husband, the motive of which is believed to be financial gain.

F3: Yeah.

F4: Yeah.

F2: Do you want to take a photo of the victorious team?

F4: Yeah.

F3: And like with the screens, please.

F4: Oh absolutely, I've got to take a photo of the screens. 

F2: [00:00:22]: With all the clues and then someone can work it out.
Part 89:

F1:	[2023/05/16 18:07:37 GMT+0000] This is what Cherie wrote to Chris, and Chris wrote to Cherie.

F3:	Oh, so smart, yes.

F2:	Oh, I've got that, I was trying to write with it. F…

F1:	Good thought, Suzanne.

F2:	F…so we think the F is a C…

F1:	So that's back four.

F2:	C…oh well I was just going to go…but I just wondered if it was actually straightforward, why have they given us that clue and then not let us use it? A, C, D, E…

F3:	He's young, wait what was her age? He's [inaudible] 

[00:00:40]:, so he's 28, whatever. Oh Cherie is like ten years older than he is.

F2:	Okay, so if we thought that was… 

F3:	He's fairly attractive. 
F2:	…seriously? 

F3:	[inaudible] 

[00:00:58]: pay attention.

	I don't like the code, guys, I like doing graphs.

F2:	No, I don't blame you.

F1:	This is why you haven't done any of them.

F3:	Look behind you, I worked.

	I have a graph for you guys, and a table.

F1:	I know. 

F4:	That's lovely.

F2:	Oh it doesn't work, it never works.

F1:	So, if it's the same pattern, working backwards, and this is four back, and I just traced it back, so we'd start with seven.

F2:	Okay. I love your perseverance, I admire it. Hold on. So D, seven back? One, two, three, four…

F1:	Shit, did I do this right?

F2:	…five, six, seven, it's a W, it's back to W.

F1:	704, 704, 704, 704, 704, 7, 

[00:02:23]: I think that's right. Yeah, yeah. Okay, right, 

[00:02:34]: so W…Part 73: 
F3:	[2023/05/16 17:48:18 GMT+0000] And then, so this was like October stuff, when did shit start happening? Bad things? Can we get his notes, the yellow pages. 

F2:	I've got that somewhere. 
F3:	So she talked on 18th October to 

[00:00:12]: [inaudible]. 
F1:	So October 13th, rock through back window. 
F3:	Okay, so… 
F1:	October 19th, two fires in one night. F3:	So the first thing is October what? 
F1:	Thirteenth. 
F3:	October 13th, start of… 
F2:	First of September, there was a fire in the bar, and in July there were petty burglaries. 

F3:	And which one? 

F2:	In July. 

F3:	July burglaries, and after that? 
F2:	Fire in September. 
F3:	And first…September. So this is when things start. And then on 18th October, Cherie talks to the development guy. And then you can see here that like, he emails again November, 'I appreciate the big decisions, like this won't take time, but I hope to hear from you soon, to finalise the offer.' And then he didn't hear from her. 
F2:	Aha. 
F3:	And in November, he emailed to Webster directly, and he cited all those emails, that's how Webster learned… 
F2:	Oh, he's written to him? 

F3:	Yeah, so 'Dear Mr Webster, I apologise for reaching out to you directly…' 
F2:	Oh, 23rd November? 
F3:	Yeah, 23rd November. 
F1:	Oh, and then, 23rd November, 'What is she thinking, why would she go behind my back like that?' So he found out. 
F2:	Yeah, yeah, yeah. So this is some of his notes? 
F1:	[00:01:00]: Yeah.Part 72: 
F2:	[2023/05/16 17:47:45 GMT+0000] And who's he talking to? 
F3:	So she's talking to this guy. 
F2:	Okay, so it's just a new person, a new company? 
F3:	Yeah. This is the people who probably want to do the development shit. 
F2:	Yeah. 
F3:	So, 'Thank you for taking the time to speak with me with this morning, my husband and I have been so troubled what's happening at the bar…' 
F2:	They're trying to scare him off. 


F3:	Yeah. 'Running Old Scratch means so much to Nick, but these days I can't shake the feeling that something terrible is going to happen to him. As you can imagine, he's been preoccupied recently, so he asked me to handle the sale directly.' 
F2:	Yeah. 
F3:	Liar, pants on fire.

	'I hope you understand.' And so here the guy says, ''No trouble at all, I will be happy to discuss the details, I think you'll find them quite reasonable.’ She says, 'I'm glad that we were able to come to agreement, we need a few weeks to put our affairs in order, and then we should be ready to finalise, thank you your patience…' 

F2:	[00:00:30]: Oh they're so like…F1:	[2023/05/16 17:42:36 GMT+0000] That seems wrong, doesn't it? Have I missed something? Oh I've missed words, yeah, no wonder. Y back seven.

F2:	Y back seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, R.

[00:00:05]: [inaudible].

F1:	Sorry not seven, four.

F3:	[00:00:05]: [Voices overlap].

F1:	One, two, three, four, U.

F3:	Ella, note it down.

F1:	U, sorry Suzanne.

F2:	No it's okay.

	You've got the hard job.

F1:	Okay, D back seven.

F2:	D? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, W.

F1:	I feel like you might be right about

[00:00:21]: [this affair?].

F3:	Oh, she's such a bitch. Cherie.

F2:	She is, yeah, we got that, we need the evidence though.

F1:	Yeah, N back four.

F2:	I. It's always nice when it's a common letter, you think.

F1:	Yeah. P back seven.

F2:	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, M.

	I said M.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Just checking.

F1:	It just seems weird.

F2:	You think it should…

F1:	W, I, T, M, seems like a weird word.

F3:	What was Vinegar Tom shit, why did we have Vinegar Tom shit?

F2:	Tom shit? Some witch said she wanted, it was in the blog, I think.

F3:	Aha.

F1:	Yeah, yeah.

F2:	The blog's over here.

F3:	Thank you.

F1: 	T, M…S back four.

F2:	O.

	[00:00:41]: It could still be, it could be something else, it could be…
F2:	[2023/05/16 17:40:00 GMT+0000] W? One, two, three, four, S, is, yeah?

F1:	Yeah. Zero…P back seven.

F2:	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, I think that was I, let me do that again, P, one, two three, four, five, six, seven, yeah, I.

F1:	X back four.

F2:	One, two, three, four, T.

F3:	[00:00:37]: [inaudible] start organising things on the table.

F2:	Do you want the letters out here, I've written them out?

F1:	Oh, this is a new one.

F2:	Oh, it's a new one, okay.

F3:	[00:00:50]: [inaudible] off to a different table.

F1:	Sorry, 407, 407, 407, 407, 40…so L back seven.

F2:	L? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, E.

F1:	V back four.

F2:	V? One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four, R.

F1:	Okay. Q back seven.

F3:	[00:01:18]: [Voices overlap] photo.

F2:	Q? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, J.

F3:	Where are the other photos?

F1:	Y back four.

F2:	Y, one, two, three, how many sorry?

FI:	Four. Sorry

F2:	U. I thought you said four and then I heard something in my head.

F1:	A back seven.

F2:	A back seven? Gosh tricky. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, T.

F1:	Getting there, ish, kind of.

	Okay, I'm just going to write 407, 407 

[00:01:58]: [inaudible].

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	D back four.

F2:	D? One, two, three, four, Z. 

F1:	Have I mucked this up? Seven, four…let's see, T back seven?

F2:	T? Seven?

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	[00:02:35]: M.
F2:	[2023/05/16 17:38:23 GMT+0000] We couldn't solve it until we'd got the bloody thing open. Ooh.

F1:	Right, okay.

F2:	Okay.

F1:	E, back four.

F2:	E back four.

	What is this, so, if we move E back four, we get V, is that what you're saying? No, we get A.

F1:	A? Okay.

F3:	[00:00:22]: [inaudible].

F2:	Say that again, E back four?

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	One, two, three, if you go back four, oh sorry…

F3:	[00:00:30]: [inaudible].

F1:	One, two, three four, yeah, so A. That's fine.

	So I'm writing it, that's fine. Can you move F back seven?

F2:	F, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, Y.

	Does that make sense?

F1:	That doesn't seem right, no.

F2:	So F back seven?

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Yeah.

F3:	Does it make sense?

F1:	Oh no, that does make sense, that's fine. X back four.

F2:	X, one, two, three, four…T.

F1:	And then T back seven.

F2:	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven N.

	Is it making any sense at all?

F1:	I think so. And then I back four.

F2:	I? One, two, three, four, E.

F1:	Any time, I feel like this should be an M, but…

F2:	Yeah, well it could be. It doesn't really matter as long as we get the sentence, yeah.

F1:	It's fine, yeah. Right, 407, 407, 40…P back seven.

F2:	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, I?

F1:	[00:01:37]: W back four.
F2:	[2023/05/16 17:34:53 GMT+0000] Interlopers will be banished to the…

F3:	Who's is this, who does this belong to?

F2:	Oh, she got it in the house, his office, and it's the person who's murdered, office.

F3:	And how do we have this?

F2:	She found it when she was looking through his notes.

F3:	Whose notes? Chris's notes?

F1:	The dead guy. Nick.

F3:	Ah.

F2:	The bar lady, found that when she was going through the office, found that at the same time, but hasn't been able to open that, 'cause she thinks there's something important in it.

	Interloper will be banished…to the bottom of the Devil's Well.

F3:	So this is…what's the guy's name?

F2:	So this doesn't tell us anything, except…

F1:	Nick Webster.

F3:	Yeah, Nick Webster, okay.

	Why don't 

[00:00:48]: [inaudible].

F1:	Me at the Stone Circle and Devil's Well.

F3:	Can you give me that again, let me try again, maybe I didn't [inaudible] 

[00:00:55]:, yeah.

F1:	[00:00:57]: [voices overlap]?

F3:	Yeah.

F1:	Manufactured by the Lucy Fair Match Co, Old Scratch Tavern. So it's…Old Scratch Tavern matches, but…I don't know if that means anything.

F3:	Shit.

F2:	So…there's…what do you think the point of this is, other than the 

[00:01:29]: [inaudible]?

F1:	I don't know. 

F2:	I wonder if the letters were relevant that were cut out, but I can't…

F1:	Oh, so I wonder if it's this word interloper, 'cause it's not a very common word, right?

F3:	[00:01:43]: [inaudible] in Polish as well.
F2:	[2023/05/16 17:29:54 GMT+0000] Oh yeah, when you, was it the guy's, the deputy's, he took some photos, and he said, when I was popping out, I noticed something that might be useful.

F3:	What car does he drive, Toyota?

F1:	Toyota?

F3:	Yeah, that's his car.

F2:	…and took a piece into his car.

F3:	Yeah, that's his, that's Toyota.

F1:	So this is his car?

F2:	Yeah.

F3:	Where were his boots? What's his name, Chris…

F1:	Chris.

F2:	So that's the deputy's.

F1:	'On my way out, I took a peek into his car, I noticed something that might be useful.' So is there anything else in here?

F3:	Chris's boots, where were they?

F1:	In Chris's car.

F3:	No, no, but the photo, what's the photo of?

	Yeah, what's that?

F2:	Have you found out where it's from?

F1:	We don't know.

F3:	So it's Chris's, and the matches, Chris's boots and matches, and Joan's matches, right, in one place?

F1:	Oh…

F2:	Oh yeah, the matches.

F1:	…so it could be that the matches ended up somewhere where he was investigating.

F2:	I mean, he could just be a smoker, but…

F4:	Have we looked inside here?

F2:	No.

F1:	Oh, is there some other combination we need to try and figure out?

F3:	…plus matches.

F1:	How annoying.

[00:03:05]: [voices overlap] 

F2:	[00:03:05]: [inaudible] this code, let's see if this code, what happens if this code was giving us the number?

F3:	[00:03:14]: Oh fuck off.
F3:	[2023/05/16 17:29:12 GMT+0000] I agree with you, they don't look like a match, it pissed me off.

F1:	Yeah, that is annoying. Yeah, weird. That seems like the closest, 'cause it's got…

	Yeah, guess, because, you know, what's clear will leave the…I think it is this one.

F3:	Yeah, it's this one, and these are more likely to be, these ones as well, because they have two bits and the other shoes don't have two bits like that.

F1:	Yeah, men's so that helps us, it's a man's shoe. 

F3:	Yeah, available 1999 to present.

F2:	Where did we find this shoe

F1:	So there's a picture of a footprint here.

F3:	And the one who was doing things.

F2:	And of course, it's an Inverse isn't it?

F1:	Yeah, so we're thinking it's this one.

F2:	Yeah. And do we know her shoe size.

F1:	This is just men's.

F2:	Just men's.

F1:	Men's. 

F2:	So where was this found?

F3: 	We don't know, I think this is the photos that was…

F2:	Oh look, there's matches there?

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	Yeah. I think this is the photo that Carmen took, right? I'm not sure where this was.

F1:	So this is another pair of shoes.

F3:	These are the boots, these are these boots.

F1:	Yeah. 

[00:00:40]: Oh, so this is from someone's car.
F3:	[2023/05/16 17:28:00 GMT+0000] So this is like [inaudible]

	[00:00:01]:, no, where does it start? Here, October 13, rock through back window, nothing on cams, two fires, fire department thinks I'm crazy, find out when darling's anniversary present will be ready. So he's thinking about his wife. Fire near parking lot, cam only. One racoon, below cam loading dock, see the devil in the woods, but I'm just not fast enough. Three fires in the woods tonight, no signs on my cams. Biggest fire yet, this was a close one, remember to pick up darling's gift. [inaudible]

	[00:00:32]: don't be late for dinner, reservation tomorrow, don't want a repeat of last year, so there's some troubles in the paradise.

F1:	Okay, yeah.

F2:	Remember, he had to sleep in the pub or something?

F1:	Yeah, for a week after he forgot the anniversary. Yeah.

F3:	A note in the mailbox, 'you'll burn for what you've done'. So this is like, this weird shit is definitely the witch. Fire by the loading dock, a burnt wall pretty bad, still no structural damage. Prints, though the devil's.

F1:	Okay, did you…?

F3:	I couldn't find them, I couldn't match them. I think it's…it could be these ones, but I don't, there's nothing really.

F1:	It could be these. Let me have a quick look, just so I know what's in here.

F3:	Yeah.

	These are the same ones that are on the photo.

F1:	Okay. Is this…?

F3:	I don't know where it's from.

F1:	Okay. Yeah, this isn't very clear, so that'll be hard to match. 

	It looks like there's something in the middle?

F3:	No, I think it's those ones. Wait, I think it's the same ones. But I'm not sure about these ones, matching these, but this is I'm pretty sure.

F1:	It looks quite triangly though? [01:30:00] Is there nothing that…?

F3:	See?

F1:	Yeah. This doesn't look like this.

F3:	No.

F1:	[00:01:12]: It doesn't look like that.
F2:	[2023/05/16 17:25:52 GMT+0000] Why do you think is who if it's D, D, shouldn't that be W, H?

F1:	It says the code repeats, so we're thinking it's not going to be one shift, but like letter by letter, and then it'll repeat. 

	And then zero and U…five, six, seven, yeah, I'm going up. I don't know.

F3:	I have to say this is not the fun part of the game.

F1:	No, it's not.

F2:	Shall we pause, and get on with the clues, and then see if this comes out? 'Cause is this essential to find this one at the moment?

F1:	No, I think we can continue and then come back to it.

F3:	I don't know how many other information, like…

F1:	Let's have a look at this again, can I just see here?

F3:	Sure.

F2:	I'm going to write out, while you all talk about it, I'm going to write the code out with the different letters, so it's all on one sheet.

F1:	I think we need to try and match the footprint with one of these reports.

F3:	And there's also [these ones here on the?] 

	[00:02:03]: notes, we haven't read the notes.

F1:	[00:02:08]: Okay.
F1:	[2023/05/16 17:23:56 GMT+0000] This is not making any sense to me.

F3:	…so maybe repeat in a way that for every letter, you have the different thing, so this one is like +3, this is +1, this +8, and then it repeats like that.

F1:	I just tried 1, 3, 8 and it wasn't working, but maybe it's a different order. So this should be whose right?

F3:	Yeah, this is whose?

F2:	Oh yeah, whose?

F1:	And so, if we try and figure out the code from there?

F3:	Yeah, exactly.

F1:	Yeah, so it was shifting this way, B to A, so D to…

F2:	Whose?

F1:	…two, three, four, five, six, seven, shift seven, then D to H, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, it seems weird but okay. And then zero. And then U…which way was I going? One, two…

F3:	But why are you going in different directions?

F1:	Was I going in different directions or should I be?

F3:	I'm asking why you're going in different directions?

F1:	So I was going right to left, so D, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And then D again, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and then U would be two.

	I'll try it the other direction and see if that makes anymore sense. So D to W. That would be 19, 

	[00:01:50]: and then to H, one, two, three, four…
F3:	[2023/05/16 17:20:54 GMT+0000] No.

F1:	No, that's nonsense.

F3:	Well there should be an article, right, somewhere?

	I mean, it's hard to come up with the sentence without an article, right?

F1:	This apostrophe, U, is annoying me.

F3:	Who's…

F1:	Who's…but then it's a double letter, which is weird, right?

F3:	D, D, O…U, and that's U, right? Could U, B, S?

F1:	We were trying to figure that out, but then it doesn't make sense for the rest of them. It wasn't aligning into words. Any luck?

F2:	No.

F1:	No?

F2:	I've tried 'the' and 'at'.

F3:	'It repeats.' The code repeats.

F1:	The code repeats, I knew it. The code repeats. Maybe we need to try the 138 pattern. So, for D we moved one, A, B, C…

F2:	Actually there's a lot of Js. The most common letters are Js and Us.

F1:	B, C…

F2:	Actually there might be more Js than…

F1:	Hold on, let me write this again.	

F3:	'The code repeat.' So I mean, like every word…

F2:	J…we want, one of these to have J…J or U to be a vowel basically, I would say. It's only if these make J a vowel. That one doesn't. Oh, J makes I, this one I've crossed out, there's a J, I here.

	Any others make…?

F3:	So this is definitely a W, H word because this is a question, this is a sentence, so this is a W, H…whose, where's, when's, what. So this is whose, maybe for every…

	[00:03:00]: look…
F3:	[2023/05/16 17:20:12 GMT+0000] What could be a two letter word, starting 

	[00:00:01]: [inaudible]?

F2:	That first two letter is T, T…

F1:	Is…

F2:	So if I rub this all out now and start again. If we think that…

F3:	But the U can't be V, right?

F1:	Yeah, no, I was just brainstorming words?

F3:	So this could be, can I write it down?

F1:	Aha.

F3:	So all three letter words, V, F, F, or, right?

F1:	No, so it can't be V, F, F, because it repeats right?

F3:	Okay, B, V, P?

F1:	P, V?

F3:	P, V. What else is a three worder? Is this a three letter?

F1:	I guess, J, G, L…

F3:	And V…

F1:	I think that's U, I, H…

F3:	So which one would make sense to be, this could be E right? E…so what if H is E and U, I is T, H?

F1:	So U, I, H becomes D…so that's, let's see if it fits a pattern. So, A, B, C, D, E…F, G, H, so that would be three. H, I, J, K, so that wouldn't follow a pattern, 'cause H and I is just, that would be one, and… Hold on…U, I, H could potentially be, but 

[00:00:33]: that wouldn't make sense, T, H, I…
F1:	[2023/05/16 17:17:49 GMT+0000] What else could be apostrophe something? 

F3:	Guys, do you remember Nola and Courtney?

F1:	No.

F3:	No?

F1:	Okay.

F3	Record, repeat, I knew it. Does that help you?

F1:	Not sure, maybe.

F3:	Still can't crack the code, and then…so it took him like three days to crack the code.

F1:	Wow, we'll be here, see you on Sunday then.

F2:	We've got a lot of Us in this, we've got a lot of Us.

F1:	The code repeats, could it be shift one, shift three, shift eight, and it keeps going like that? I mean that's evil, if it is?

F3:	Okay, so no, I don't think that it means…so the most common letter in the English alphabet is E, so what letter repeats here most?

F2:	U repeats an awful lot.

F3:	So that must be E, right?

	And that's the shift that, so you need to find…

F1:	So, two letter is like…

F2:	This is the…this is going to be…

F1:	Yeah like one of these could be the…

F2:	Oh.

F3:	The, yeah.

F1:	D, B, U, could be the…

F3:	Yeah, exactly.

F1:	Do we see D, B, U again?

	D, P, V, U, F, F…

F3:	This could be E again, right?

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	E, what would the word with E, two words?

F2:	Oh, B's common, actually B comes up twice. D…[inaudible]

	[00:02:22]: D…
F1:	[2023/05/16 17:14:59 GMT+0000] But hopefully that helps with that?

F2:	Well, I've not been able to break it, but let's say that is an S. Someone's…

F1:	D, D, O…

F2:	It hasn't made sense to me, any of them, but [inaudible] 

	[00:02:16]: code, we've now learned how to interpret, and you'd say that's an S.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	So when we see a U, that's an S. S…

F1:	A U is S.

F2:	S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, okay.

F1:	So that wouldn't be this one, do any of these go U to S? 

	Oh no, but we need to do it again, yeah.

F2:	Well, so if that is it, then that's D…so if U is an S, then it's up and a D is a B, B…

F1:	O?

F2:	O…B, B, O…but that…

F1:	What does O become?

F2:	O becomes N.

F1:	B, B, N apostrophe S.

F2:	But that could be someone's name so…

F1:	Yeah, let's keep going. Z?

F2:	B. Oh I'm going up aren't I? Sorry, Z is X. 

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Mmm, it's not looking good.

F1:	B?

F2:	[00:02:46]: B is Z. No, it's not no, shit.
Part 53:

F1:	[2023/05/16 17:11:30 GMT+0000] R?

F2:	O. Oh, M, N, O, yeah, O.

F4:	[00:00:04]: inaudible .

F1:	E?

F2:	B.

F3:	[00:00:08]: [inaudible], this was Donna. 

F1:	E?

F2:	Did you say E?

F4:	[inaudible] 

	[00:00:14]: was actually there 

	[00:00:15]: [inaudible].

F2:	Yeah, but I think I just said the same thing twice, didn't I? D?

F1:	D, the higher D is A.

	E is B again.

F1:	O?

F2:	Is that an L or an A. O?

F1:	O?

F2:	The higher O is L.

F1:	And then H.

F2:	The higher H is E.

F1:	E. However improbable…

F2:	Yeah, okay, remains improbable. I think we are wasting our time here.

F1:	I know, I'll just finish this one for completeness.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	But, I'll manage. F2:	Oh, but, you know what this is? F1:	It might help with this. F2:	This is teaching us the code for that. F1:	For that, that's what I was thinking. F3:	Who said… F1:	Oh that's annoying, 'cause I…so which one is it? F3:	Who had those, the matches? F1:	The matches, Donna left the matches. F3:	Oh and whose shoes are those, do we know? F1:	Oh, someone had sent off footprints to a lab. F2:	These are these. F1:	But they were waiting for the results. Oh, so these are the results. I don't remember, we'll need to check, it was in here, there was something about footprints [in a book?] 

	[00:01:22]: I want to say whether it was maybe, I'd like to check this Chris guy.Part 52:

F2:	[2023/05/16 17:10:02 GMT+0000] Am I going upwards? Yeah. Oh, is that right? I've just wondered if I've gone up and down instead of…the higher L is I, sorry.

F1:	Higher L, I?

F2:	Sorry, the higher L.

F1:	Yeah, Q?

F2:	The higher Q is N.

F1:	V?

F2:	The higher V is S.

F1:	Okay.

F2:	Is that it?

F1:	[00:00:26]: [inaudible] …

F2:	The impossible, whatever remains…oh is that it, is that all this?

F1:	No.

F2:	Oh.

F1:	K?

F2:	The higher K is H.

F3:	I mean at this point I would figure out the code right, like…

F1:	I know.

F3:	They could have just told us what's there.

F2:	Well, I don't know, you can keep looking through things, and see if you find anything interesting, while we do this annoying shifting.

F1:	Where are we?

F2:	So we're just after this comma, K.

F1:	Oh yeah, K. The higher K is H.

F2:	R?

F1:	The higher R is O.

F2:	Z?

F1:	The higher Z is W.

F2:	H?

F1:	E.

F2:	L?

F1:	I.

F2:	P.

F3:	This is actually a great game.

F2:	M.

F4:	Yeah? Good, I'm glad.

F1:	S?

F2:	P.

F1:	U?

F2:	R.

F3: 	[I want to like?]

	[00:01:26]: stick to this thing.Part 51:

F1:	[2023/05/16 17:08:11 GMT+0000] And then you'd carry on, so like if A is I, then B is J, and you just write it out in that order, and then when you get to the end, start again.

F2:	I should have left more space, silly.

	Now this time I'm going down, on no this time I'm going up, 'cause I'll put them above.

F1:	Yeah, so if you just write it out, then when we get to it, it'll make it easier.

	Okay, have you got it?

F2:	Yeah, I've got it.

F1:	Z?

F2:	Z, I'm going up, is C.

F1:	K?

F2:	K is N.

F1:	D?

F2:	D is G. Does that make sense?

F1:	Okay, this is wrong, no.

F2:	Am I…maybe I should [non-speech event]…

	A, D…

F1:	Should we go down, because before we were going up, but you'd written it below?

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	So, try the other way?

F2:	Z again?

F1:	Z, yeah.

F2:	So the lower Z is, the higher Z is W.

F1:	K?

F2:	The higher K is H.

F1:	Oh that seems more likely.

F2:	Yeah, yeah.

F1:	D?

F2:	D? The higher D is A.

F1:	W?

F2:	The higher W is T.

F1:	H?

F2:	[00:01:18]: [B?]. 

F1:	Y?

F2:	V.

F1:	And then…I'll just, okay, U?

F2:	High, R.

F1:	H?

F2:	E.

F1:	P?

F2:	M.

F1:	D?

F2:	A.

F3:	[00:01:41]: [inaudible].

F2:	L.

F3:	[00:01:45]: [inaudible].

F2:	L? O.

F1:	[00:01:49]: O?

F2:	[00:01:50]: Yeah.Part 50:

F2:	[2023/05/16 17:07:11 GMT+0000] C is M, and then N is L.

F1:	Right, C will be B?

F2:	C will be B, sorry, yes, C…

F1:	And then L, E? Yeah. When you have excluded the impossible, and now we need to shift three.

F2:	Okay.

F1:	When you have excluded the impossible…

F3:	Oh guys, it's the Sherlock Holmes code.

F2:	So we have to shift…

F1:	Only the plausible…

F2:	A is now D. 

F1:	Do you want to write out the next one, where we need to shift A to I.

F3:	[inaudible] 

	[00:00:39]: but yes, oh wait, I don't know the alphabet actually.

F1:	What?

F3:	I'll need to look it up, I can't remember it all. 

F1:	You're ridiculous.

F3:	I'm not kidding. 

	Not only in English, but also in Russian and Ukranian.

	Well I can do some letters, and then at some point I'll, like A, B, C, D, E, F, G…F, L, K, M, N…

F2:	Okay, do you want to…

F3:	I wasn't kidding, I'm not just lazy.

F1:	Here you go, the alphabet.

F3:	So what do I need to shift?

F1:	Eight, so A becomes I…

F2:	[00:00:56]: And then you carry on from there.Part 49:

F2:	[2023/05/16 17:04:35 GMT+0000] D is C.

F1:	M?

F2:	M is L.

F1: 	V?

F2:	V is U.

F1:	And then F is…D?

F2:	F is E again?

F1:	F is E, just making sure, right hold on? What letter am I on? E, X, C, L, U, oh E is D, sorry.

F2:	E is D, yeah.

F1:	F is…

F2:	F is E.

F1:	And then E is D again.

F2:	E is D.

	So that sounds like excluded.

F1:	When you have excluded.

	U?

F2:	U is T.

F1:	I?

F2:	I is H.

F1:	And then this will be the…a J?

F2:	J is I.

F1:	I?

F2:	I is H.

F1:	Sorry not I, N.

F2:	N is M.

F1:	Q?

F2:	Q is P.

F1:	P?

F2: 	Q is P, yeah.

F1:	Yeah, and what's P?

F2:	And then P again? Oh.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Okay, that's funny. 

F1:	So it goes Q, P.

F2:	Q, is P, O...

F1:	Oh, and T?

F2:	T is S.

F1:	J?

F2:	Is it two Ss?

F1:	Yeah. 

F2:	Yeah, got that. J is I.

F1:	And then [inaudible] 

	[00:02:34]: be impossible.Part 48:

F1:	[2023/05/16 17:03:46 GMT+0000] Okay, so F.

F2:	F transposed…sorry let me just get this right, which of the lines…

F1:	So you're going from top to bottom.

F2:	So F would be G.

F1:	Can you check I.

F2:	I is J.

F1:	This seems wrong. X?

F2:	X is Y. Y.

F1:	Are we going the wrong way?

	Shift one. B to A. Because if we shift to the opposite way.

F2:	Do we just right WHY, as why?

F1:	So X, I said was W, am I doing this the right way round? Oh, so down to up.

	So F, try F.

F2:	Okay, F, I'm going down, E.

F1:	Yeah, that makes more sense. O?

F2:	O…N.

F1:	Yeah, okay, when. Z?

F2:	Z, Y.

F1:	P?

F2:	P, O.

F3:	I don't have to think about that.

F1:	V?

F2:	V, U.

F1:	Okay. When you…

	I?

F2:	I? H.

F1:	B?

F2:	A.

F1:	W?

F3:	Do you like my…

F2:	V.

F1:	F, I'm guessing E?

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	And then E, Y?

F2: 	Did you say E, it was D, or did you say E or Y?

F1:	I said F was E.

F2:	Yeah and then what was the next letter?

F1:	And then Y.

F2:	Oh Y sorry, I was, Y…is X.

F1:	X.

	[00:00:47]: D?F2:	[2023/05/16 17:02:54 GMT+0000] Okay.

F3:	But still she's a man right?

F1:	Can we…so it might be this, right, this might be quite an easy code to crack. Do we have? Yeah, we have paper.

F2:	You say it's an easy code to crack.

F1:	Well I don't know, but let's see. Let's just shift one, what's the letter before X, if we just do exactly what it says.

F2:	Oh, yeah, okay. 

F1:	Yeah, let's write out the alphabet, it's easier

F2:	We'll look at the map guys.

F1:	No, not yet, I'm just thinking, this was the initial letter, so let's just kind of…

F3:	December 304, okay. Let's start at the 304.

F1:	Yeah, this envelope would be good to figure out as well. Okay. So before x, what is the letter for x?

F2:	X? Oh sorry, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

F1:	W?

F2:	Yeah, W. So I wonder if you just wrote the…if we wrote, which way would you then transpose the…?

F1:	So it shifts one, so B becomes A.

F2:	B becomes A, so B, C, D, E…

F1:	So if I tell you a letter, and you look it up, maybe is that the fastest way to do this?

F2:	[00:00:50]: Yeah.
Part 43:

F2:	[2023/05/16 16:58:15 GMT+0000] She's not that witchy woman? Okay. She was out at 3:30 when this was done, so she might have seen something, even if she's not the witch. F1:	She might have seen something.

	Or she might have been the devil, outside the window, if she had the lights out so that they wouldn't see the car. F2:	Yeah, she could have been. Yeah, I think it's significant. So the silver Lincoln is another significant, this is very significant, there's some significant times on this. F1:	Yeah.

	Did you have any luck with this code? F2:	Well, I can write all the letters down. F3:	Can we read the last question? F1:	Yeah, sure, so this is Cherie Webster, so the wife. F3:	What's her car, silver Mercedes Benz, no, that's…? F1:	Yeah, she teaches at a fitness centre.

	'At the funeral she kept telling me how highly her husband thought of me, and how grateful she was as I'd always been there for him. Losing Nick has been hard on her, but she's been really gracious. She and Nick were sort of an odd couple, she's so polished, and Nick, at his best, was kind of a mess. A loveable mess, but the kind of guy who buys a round of drinks for the whole bar, then forgets his wallet. She could be kind of hard on him sometimes. Like once he missed their anniversary, and he slept in the bar for a week. 

	[00:01:27]: But he was crazy about her, called her the love of his life.'Part 41:

F3:	[2023/05/16 16:56:12 GMT+0000] Collision between the black and the blue car at 4.01, which is right in the middle of the time of death.

F2:	Oh yes. h F1:	And it says, 'booked Lincoln driver for DUI, so driving under the influence, so someone 

	[00:00:16]: [voices overlap]?

F3:	Collision of the blue and black car was DUI as well, right.

F1:	I'm also not sure, so there's, Joan drives a blue Volkswagen Beetle, but I don't know, I'm assuming it's not her?

F3:	No it wasn't a Volkswagen, it was a Lincoln.

F2:	There was a silver Lincoln tailed at C30 so that's within the time of death.

F3:	Who has a Lincoln?

F1:	Donna.

F3:	Donna has a Lincoln and…

F1:	But I think it's a black Lincoln right?

F2:	Okay, so there's two Lincolns in this. There's a silver one at C30 traffic stops a Lincoln.

F1:	Yeah, so that was Donna.

F3:	So that was Donna, and that one wasn't Donna.

F2:	On lights out, oh her light were out, on that road and…

F1:	At Country Road?

F3:	So she was just leaving so that's like three, so this is 3:29 or whatever, that was when Donna was leaving the place. And that's like, a few minutes later, CCTV.

F2:	[00:01:02]: Oh.Part 101:

F1:	[2023/05/16 18:26:19 GMT+0000] One back from J.

F1:	And three back from L.

F2:	I.

F1:	Okay. Whatever, let's see.

F2:	Yeah, I think so, 'cause some of the letters are a bit ambiguous, and they might have tried to trick us.

F1:	Yeah, they might have made a mistake with their stupid codes, that is horrible.

F3:	[00:01:11]: [inaudible].

F1:	One back from C, so it's B.

F2:	B.

F1:	Three back from P.

F2:	One, two three, M. Is it going to be my?

F2:	[00:01:21]: T.Part 103:

F1:	[2023/05/16 18:27:41 GMT+0000] Okay, this has stopped making sense, I must have made a mistake somewhere, 131, 131, 131, 131, 131, 131, 131, 131, so this should be 131. Where were we?

F3:	Where do we stop, where is this…? Is this J?

F2:	Do you want me to find three forward from F, do you want to go through…?

F1:	So one from C.

F2:	One from U, T.

F1:	One from I.

F2:	One from I, H.

F1:	Three from H, so that'll be E.

F2:	E.

F1:	Can't wait to see you, and mind if I borrow, never mind, there must have been a space here, borrow the…

F2:	Boots.

F1:	Ooh…where were we, is it this one we just did? Borrow the…yeah.

F2:	F, was it F?

	I'm pointing to it, E, what would it be?

F1:	[2023/05/16 16:59:44 GMT+0000] 'Courtney who works the day shift at Old Scratch, loves Cherie's bar class at the fitness centre, says Cherie's kind of a perfectionist but in a good way. Apparently she was accepted to study ballet at Indianapolis, when she was 14, but her scholarship fell through.'

	There was something else about Indianapolis?

F2:	Was that the bonkers company that was going to destroy the land in…

F1:	Yeah, I think so.

F2:	Indianapolis it was. Evil corporation from 

	[00:00:16]: Indianapolis, yeah.

F1:	Yeah. She broke the news that she doesn't have plans to open Old Scratch. I don't know how I could bear it, not when there's a memory of poor Nicky round every corner.

	So potential motive could be like, getting rid of the bar, for her. But we don't know if she wants that.

F2:	I think there's a clue, for some reason, I don't know, but they've given her maiden name Houser.

F1:	Houser.

F2:	Just…

F1:	Yeah, we'll keep an eye out for it.

	'Stopped by Webster's house to drop off some condolence cards, told me that she was staying at a friend's house the night Nick died.'

F2:	[00:00:41]: Oh. 
F3:	[2023/05/16 16:43:51 GMT+0000] Or Mia's lying of course, but potentially.
F2:	I think it's true, because she, at 2.30 maybe the noise in the bar, the chap didn't leave the bar until 3.30, they went to the foxes, he'd gone by then because otherwise he would have come out. 
F1:	Well they were together chanting, right? 
 F3:	Yeah. 
F2:	For probably about an hour. 
F1:	And then by the time they were done, he was already gone because the fire had been put out… 
F2:	Yes. 
F3:	And Mia's last comment was at 4.47 so I imagine she came back home, when she wrote the comment. 
 F2:	Yeah, I think you're right. 
F3:	So they could have been together, that's… 
F2:	Yeah, it's a good call. 
F1:	I think so… 
F3:	But it's not a 100 per cent right. 
F1:	No, but they were together up until they left the fox and the fire was already put out, so yeah. 
F2:	Aha, good. 
F1:	Right, now we've got Chris Thompson. 
F3:	Did we have their names somewhere? 
F1:	No, but I think he's probably the deputy. F2:	I bet you he's the sheriff, the deputy sheriff, yeah, that would be my guess. 

F1:	Yeah, oh… 
F3:	Deputy. 
F2:	[00:00:44]: Oh yeah.
