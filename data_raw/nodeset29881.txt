F1:	[2023/05/16 16:39:02 GMT+0000] …some evil corporation from Indianapolis wants to sow the land near Devil's Well with poison or something.’

F3:	Sorry, what?

F1:	She's claiming that an evil corporation from Indianapolis wants to sow the land near Devil's Well with poison.

F3:	Or something.

F1:	Or something.

F2:	Ah, but she might be right, there might be a corporation wants to buy it, and she's just got, because she kind of sees the evil in everything, sees evil. So that might be a factor might it not?

F1:	'It sounds pretty out there to me, but I've heard stranger things I guess. Then again, she's also been saying Nick got what he deserved, so who knows?'

F2:	Oh.

F2:	Aha.

F1:	Interesting. 'Went over to her place, hoping to ask her some questions, but she said she won't talk to interlopers from Old Scratch bent on destroying life.'

F2:	She's bonkers.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	But she also put a fox outside his bar, so I think we knew that already.

F1:	'Then she threatened to shoot me if I don't get off her property, so I left.'

	But said, Old Scratch bent on destroying life, so she obviously thinks Nick and the bar are doing something bad.

F2:	[00:00:58]: I think you're right.
