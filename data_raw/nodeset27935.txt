F3:	[2023/05/16 17:20:12 GMT+0000] What could be a two letter word, starting 

	[00:00:01]: [inaudible]?

F2:	That first two letter is T, T…

F1:	Is…

F2:	So if I rub this all out now and start again. If we think that…

F3:	But the U can't be V, right?

F1:	Yeah, no, I was just brainstorming words?

F3:	So this could be, can I write it down?

F1:	Aha.

F3:	So all three letter words, V, F, F, or, right?

F1:	No, so it can't be V, F, F, because it repeats right?

F3:	Okay, B, V, P?

F1:	P, V?

F3:	P, V. What else is a three worder? Is this a three letter?

F1:	I guess, J, G, L…

F3:	And V…

F1:	I think that's U, I, H…

F3:	So which one would make sense to be, this could be E right? E…so what if H is E and U, I is T, H?

F1:	So U, I, H becomes D…so that's, let's see if it fits a pattern. So, A, B, C, D, E…F, G, H, so that would be three. H, I, J, K, so that wouldn't follow a pattern, 'cause H and I is just, that would be one, and… Hold on…U, I, H could potentially be, but 

[00:00:33]: that wouldn't make sense, T, H, I…
