Part 31: F3 [2023/05/12 19:26:05 GMT+0000]:	Okay. How, and why? F1:	How, yeah, that is the only thing is, because it says specifically that he died from a fall. F3:	Uh-huh. F1:	So, it seems like the how has been answered. F3:	Uh-huh. F1:	Like, it seems like what he had to do was draw him into the woods alone, where he could… F2:	Yeah, near the cliff, and then just shove him off. F1:	…and like, just push, shove him off. Which it doesn't seem very satisfactory, but I don't think that we've found anything else about another method, or like, anything else that would…yeah. F2:	Yeah, it says… F1:	Also, the fact that, so he's in the hiking club, so he knows, probably, the countryside around the place quite well. F2:	It also says that the coroner agreed that a fall is the likely cause of death, so. F1:	Yeah, so I think that is the method. Especially if he knows, like, knows the hills, or whatever. And, yeah, the motive is because he is cheating, he's… M1:	Having an affair with… F1:	…he's having an affair with Cherie. M1:	Yeah. F1:	Who is not really happy in her marriage. F2:	Uh-huh. F1:	And she wants to sell the bar, and get out. F3:	Okay. If you're happy with that? F1:	And also, it does, and also, it kind of explains why the Sheriff's office is dismissing the case, because he works there. F2:	Uh-huh. F3:	Okay. F1:	Yeah. F3:	Good? F2:	He's the deputy, isn't he? F1:	Uh-huh. F2:	Yeah. So, it was like saying in the newspaper, or whatever, he was the one that just lived at the bottom of the cliff, rather than the top of the cliff. F3:	Okay? F1 [00:03:25]:	Okay.
