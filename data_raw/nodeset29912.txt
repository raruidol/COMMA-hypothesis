F3:	The bar-keep had this? 
F2:	The murder person had this, and we know this is the chap's foot, so it means they were together at some point. 
F1:	Why would the murder person have that? 
F2:	Well maybe he was strangling him, and it fell out of the pocket. 
F3:	No, I'm confused about this. 
F1:	No, but the murdered guy never got that? 
F3:	Didn't she leave a message for him when she left out of the bar, who did she give it to, when she

F2:	Mmm.
