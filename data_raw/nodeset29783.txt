F2 [2023/05/12 18:25:03 GMT+0000]:	Yeah, I was just going to say, the last bit of the suspect notes, Joan is then saying about the boot treads. So, I was looking at them, and there's a couple of pictures, and it seems like that one matches with the, so like the triangle design, and then the bit outside. 

F1:	Uh-huh.

F2:	And then, in the, this is the shoes, I think that's result 12. Yeah, that's result number 12, which says it's a man's shoe.

F1:	Okay.

F2:	So…

F1:	Oh, yeah, so whatever the code is in that, I'm guessing is, the date you can't forget. 

F2:	Uh-huh.

M1:	I also noticed something here.

F1:	Ah, very interesting. Okay, yeah, can you see…?

F2:	Should we, like, hold something above it?

M1:	Can we…?

F1:	No, because you're going to have to use it again.

M1:	Yeah. Let's see…

F2:	Do we have, like a light we can shine underneath it, or something?

M1:	What was inside the letter?

F1:	I don't think there was anything inside it, I think it's just an envelope?

M1:	These, or it was just the envelope?

F1:	No, I think it was just the envelope.

F2:	What's this?

F1:	So, these are the victim's notes about weird stuff that's happened.

F2:	Oh, yeah, because then we've got a bit more of a timeline, as well.

M1:	Oh, we can do it this way, okay. 

F1:	Ah, there, okay. So, this is the thing that has to be decoded, then?

M1:	Yes, yes.

F1:	Okay. It looks like, also, that somebody who has this car may have an alibi. So, there was a traffic stop of somebody at 3.31a.m., so there's a good chance that they didn't make it for the time of the crime, if they…

M1:	Who's they?

F1:	Whoever has this car.

M1 [00:01:57]:	Okay.
