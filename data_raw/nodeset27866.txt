Part 3:

F3:	[2023/05/16 16:06:43 GMT+0000] So he died early Saturday morning, and he was found early Saturday morning, right?

F2:	Oh what's the newspaper, paper, 'cause this, he must have died in December?

F1:	Yeah, it looks like it.

F2:	'Cause this must be, he died…

F1:	So, 'More recently Webster had reported a series of small fires and other disturbances at the bar. Official records show that Webster called Perdition emergency services ten times between September 1st and December 7th.'

F2:	Ten times, let me get the dates again?

F3:	So what happened there?

F1:	September 1st and December 2nd. So they were fires, and he called emergency services.

F2:	So, it's several petty burglaries in July, a fire in September, and he called ten times, so that's a bit poor.

F1:	Yeah, several. So then Carmen was a bartender at Old Scratch and said that Webster feared someone was out to get him, though she didn't know who would have wanted to harm her employer.

	So the circumstances of Webster's death led some Perdition residents, including Rohas, to speculate whether his fall might have been accidental. So that's Rohas as in Cameron Rohas. However, Sheriff McGinty was adamant these claims were groundless.

F2:	So who thought it might be…?

F1:	So Carmen Rohas, yeah.

F2:	Oh, Carmen, okay

[00:01:45]: [voices overlap], okay, yeah.
