F2:	[2023/05/16 18:35:12 GMT+0000] And I think that…well we don't know when she took the car, but I think if it's meant to be a clue… She sent…she kept sending him notes, so they had a [clandestine?] 

[18:35:22]: relationship. That's the only thing we've proved, none of the notes said, 'oh, we must run away tonight,' which is what I thought he was going to say.

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	So this is 

[18:35:31]: [mean?] 

F1:	Do you even want to know how long we've been at this?

F2:	Five minutes? Tell us…

F4:	You don't want to know.

F1:	It's, I checked, I know,

F3:	Almost three hours. 

	And then borrowed the car? Nobody…

F2:	All we could have saved is a stupid clue, back and forwards, that's the only thing we've done, that has been a waste of time.

F1:	I know, I think we've spent at least an hour on the stupid codes.

F2:	I think those codes, I would like to have my life back on that really, but I think the rest was legit, we couldn't have done it any quicker, we wrote them all slowly, we did it thoroughly.

F3:	I don't care, I mean it's fine.

F2:	Well, we could have done it quicker, if we split up jobs, but then you've got to keep the data together, so then we could have done it.

F3:	No, yeah, exactly. So, she's got the motive, right? She has the means. And she already did some things beforehand, like trying to ruin her husband's credibility. 

[00:01:00]: She borrowed a car for some reason.
