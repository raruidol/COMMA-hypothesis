Part 40:

M2	[2023/05/17 16:08:04 GMT+0000]: He's the one who did it.

F1:	He did it. 

M2:	He did it. 

M1:	Yeah. But it can't be…we can't be, like, confirmation bias-ey like, oh, yeah, he did it, and then 
[00:00:14]: [voices overlap]…

F1:	Well, wait. Wait. Let's just go through the evidence that we've got for him now. Boots.

M2:	Yeah.

M1:	Check.

M2:	His boots.

F1:	Check.

M1:	So just to make sure, that photo 
[00:00:25]: [voices overlap]…

M2:	In his Toyota.

M1:	…that photo is from the crime scene. Yeah?

F1:	No. This photo is from 
[00:00:29]: [voices overlap]…

M2:	From the back of his car.

M1:	No, that one, the…with the footprint.

M2:	This one? No idea. 

M1:	Ah. Because that's what we're going on at the moment, I think.

F1:	December the 7th at 3:33am, that's just after he was killed.

M1:	No, but that 
[00:00:52]: [on the left is] him, isn't it?

F1:	Who? Nick?

M1:	Yeah.

M2:	It's a ghost.

F1:	No. 

M1:	I think it is. Is it not? Yes, it is. Because that on the right is the lady who was saying, oh, yeah, and then when I turned around…

F1:	Oh, well, he's waiting outside and he's gone, and it could be 4:30am he was killed.

M1:	So…so but then indeed it means that at three…

M2:	Is that not…

M1:	…if this is 3:33 then the coroner said it was between 3:30 and…

F1:	And 4:30.

M1:	…4:30, but then it's not that close to 3:30…

F1	[00:01:16]: Yeah.
