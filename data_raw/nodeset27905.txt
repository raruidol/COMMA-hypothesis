Part 43:

F2:	[2023/05/16 16:58:15 GMT+0000] She's not that witchy woman? Okay. She was out at 3:30 when this was done, so she might have seen something, even if she's not the witch. F1:	She might have seen something.

	Or she might have been the devil, outside the window, if she had the lights out so that they wouldn't see the car. F2:	Yeah, she could have been. Yeah, I think it's significant. So the silver Lincoln is another significant, this is very significant, there's some significant times on this. F1:	Yeah.

	Did you have any luck with this code? F2:	Well, I can write all the letters down. F3:	Can we read the last question? F1:	Yeah, sure, so this is Cherie Webster, so the wife. F3:	What's her car, silver Mercedes Benz, no, that'sâ€¦? F1:	Yeah, she teaches at a fitness centre.
