F1:	Doreen Norville seems like she knows what's up.

F3:	Oh so this, what's her name, Joan Campbell, the Save Devil's Well Foundation person, is a fricking cult person, 'cause she called it sacred.

F1:	Oh maybe.

F3:	Looking at Ella.

F1:	Okay, so update. 'So I wound up going by myself, and it was totally bonkers. I got there at like three in the morning, and it was just me and this lady with a basket of weird herbs.

F3:	It was Campbell, right?

F1:	Maybe.

F3:	Probably.

F1:	'We spent like, 30 or 40 minutes burning herbs and chanting. At one point I heard something crashing around in the underbrush and I got worried she'd actually summoned something.

F2:	Oh well he died on 7th September.

F3:	Yeah, exactly.

F2:	So, that was the Friday night.

F3:	And she posted…

F1:	Four am, on the 7th.

F3:	So she was there.

F2:	Yeah. So, I think this is…

F1:	Yeah, so, 'Out by Devil's Well tonight,' and this is the 6th, so it went out on [inaudible]
