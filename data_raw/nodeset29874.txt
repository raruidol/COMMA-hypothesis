F1:	[2023/05/16 16:31:47 GMT+0000] So notes, oh, there seems like these are notes from Nick, 'cause it says, my favourite regular at Old Scratch, comes in three to four times a week, kills at karaoke, mops the floor with the competition at pool, always tips well. Handled the sale of the bar when Nick bought it. Okay, never mind we'll read Carmen's notes. Handled the sale of the bar when Nick bought it in 2005, the seller was [Lou Lavalle?]

[00:00:17]:, his father opened it in 1957. So Lou Lavalle was selling the bar. Very involved around town, women's choir, billiards club, [Brown and Country?]

[00:00:28]: hiking club. Billiards club? That was mentioned.

F3:	Yeah, in the article, that she likes to play. No wait, was she the one playing billiards, or was it…?

F2:	There was pool.

F3:	Carole Euber.

F2:	Carole Euber said the pool championship won't be the same without him.

F1:	Okay. Last person to leave the bar the night Nick died.

F2:	She was?

F1:	Yeah, Donna.

F3:	Last, maybe one hour before closing time. Okay, so I need to…

F2:	Have you got a time of what the last person to leave the bar, have we got that time?

F1:	No, just that it was about an hour before closing time, but maybe that means around 2.30.

F3:	Aha.

F2:	[00:00:55]: Mmm, yeah.
