Part 23 F1 [2023/05/12 19:05:55 GMT+0000]: Oh, yes. Okay, so the emails. F2: Yeah, so he's not leaving anything to his wife. F1: Hmm. F2: So… F1: So, yeah, his best friend, his, like, best employee, and an apology to that crazy woman. F2: Yeah, and he's saying, I thought you at least still cared for me, and I was a fool to think so, but better a fool than a liar, I guess. F1: Yeah. So, this email is basically her saying that they're going to sell, which he says they're not. M1: Who is, her? F1: Cherie. M1: Cherie, okay. F1: So, let's do this backwards. Erm…yeah, she says she can't shake the feeling that something terrible will happen to him. F2: Hmm. M1: Okay. F1: And she's confirming that they're going to sell it. And then, the guy that she was talking to emailed Nick. So, that is probably the first time that he found out that. F2: Yeah. F1: So, like, I think, yeah, she was going behind his back to say that they were going to sell, which means that she knew he was going to be killed, I think. F2: Uh-huh. And also, he's saying, the first one, that he's leaving £5,000 to the Save the Devil's Well Foundation. F1: Yeah, so that's like actively anti-selling it. F2: Yeah, it's not just he didn't know that she was planning for them to sell it, it's, he's completely against it. F1 [00:00:50]: Yeah.
