	'Dear Ms Gray, I'm writing because I think my boss was murdered, but I can't prove it on my own. I'm hoping someone at Gray Investigations can help me. I may give you a little background.

[00:00:18]: rowdy patrons. He even helped me rearrange my work schedule so I could be home more, when my sister was sick last year. 

	Nick was the best. Old Scratch Tavern isn't much to look at, but it's one of those places that feels like home. That was all Nick.'

F2:	Nice guy.

F1:	Yeah.

	'I guess that's why it hit me so hard when Nick died in December, it was so sudden and so bizarre. The official story is that Nick was drunk and lost his footing, but to me, strange things happened in the months leading up to his death, for me to believe it was an accident. 

	The thing is, Nick had been seeing the devil.'

F3:	That happens when you drink too much, and then you stop drinking.

F1:	Or when someone's in a cult, sacrifice, who knows?

F3:	That's alcoholic delirium.

F2:	Or he's trying to mess with your mind.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	[00:01:06]: I mean like playing games.
