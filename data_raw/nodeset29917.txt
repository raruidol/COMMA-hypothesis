F1: [2023/05/16 18:00:13 GMT+0000] I don't think it's Carmen.

F2: No, because intimidation's been happening, although you could put the intimidation to the witch's anyway, because they heard about the sale, and didn't realise it was him, and thought it was his wife. So the witch's spooky bit, could still be a misunderstanding, 'cause they heard about the sale and thought it was his fault.

 Are we missing any evidence? What's the…everything here will be a clue. What's Webster's, why have we got that, what's Webster's to do with?

F3: That's the name. Nick Webster, that's his name, right? That's when the bar opened, I guess, that's when they bought it I guess, maybe?

 So okay, we're assuming we trust Cherie's alibi, she couldn't kill, and there's nothing placing her at the place, of the location of the murder, right?

F1: Cherie, well she said she was at a friend's house, but I've not seen any evidence that would confirm that. So, I think we need to say we don't know where she was.

F3: But, was there evidence saying that she was at the area? Also, not.

F1: Also no.

F3: So she's like a big blob of nothing?

F1: I don't think so, unless she was involved in one of the car accidents?

F3: What's her car?

F2: Silver Mercedes Benz, are we talking about…

F3: Honda…no, there's no Mercedes Benz.

F2: [00:00:57]: Were you talking about Cherie.
