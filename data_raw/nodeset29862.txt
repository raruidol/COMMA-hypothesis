Part 9:

F3:	[2023/05/16 16:16:02 GMT+0000] So the guy died on 7th December, right?

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	When you're saying, yeah, December, you're saying that's the…?

F1:	Day before.

F3:	The day before.

F2:	Yeah, 6th December. 

F1:	So the message says, 'Hey, I know it's last minute, but is anyone going to this Banishing Ceremony out by Devil's Well tonight?'

F3:	Okay, so…that was on the 6th.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Oh they're indicating that maybe he was at one of those…

F3:	So we need, guys, we need a timeline.

F2:	Well, I think we keep getting the information, yeah, 'cause I think we're going to rewrite the timeline. 'Cause I think this is suggesting a sacrifice.

F1:	'I've seen flyers around town and it sounds cool, but also, do you want to get murdered or whatever? Anyone know who's organising or what their deal is?' So then someone's saying, 'No idea who's running it, but I wouldn't hang out with a bunch of strangers in the woods at night.'

F2:	That's her, isn't it? 

F1:	Yeah Mia Roma, asking what's going on with this Banishing Ceremony.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	Oh she went. Okay, sorry. So someone said, 'I can't make this ritual, I'm at a coven meeting in Indianapolis tonight. '

F2:	Oh my goodness.

F3:	Oh for fuck's sake guys.

F1:	[00:00:32]: But I promise you'll come to no harm.
