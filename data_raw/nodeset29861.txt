Part 5:

F1:	[2023/05/16 16:10:10 GMT+0000]
	Okay, so now we've got someone new, Carole Euber, a member of the old Perdition billiard's club said, 'Old Scratch's Pool Championship won't be the same without Nick Cheering us on.'

F3:	Okay, yeah, so that's just another, like, person who knows him.

F1:	Aha. So Carole…E, U, B, E, R…then we've got Donna Goddard.

F3:	This is the 

[16:10:36]: [inaudible] person?

F1:	So these are all just people who seem to be supportive. She says she's a longterm patron of Webster's bar, it's heartbreaking, like mad the best old-fashioned gin in town, and I won't be the only person having one in his honour tonight. So…

F3:	Clients.

F1:	Yeah. And funeral services will be held Sunday at 11am at 

[00:01:02]: [Bogg's?] Funeral Home. 

F2:	Funeral…on Sunday at 11am.

F3:	So it hasn't been a week, so…

F2:	So if that's Tuesday…

F3:	It doesn't mean he died on…

F2:	That will be the 6th, 7th.

F3:	Seventh.

F1:	Yes, if he died on, if this is from Tuesday, and he died on Saturday, so that would have been December 7th.

F2:	Oh good.

F1:	Yeah, and then the reception after the funeral would be at Old Scratch Tavern, so his tavern.

	Okay, on the other side of the newspaper, new developments for Devil's Well. Is this the waterfall that he died in?

F3:	[00:01:20]: Yeah.
