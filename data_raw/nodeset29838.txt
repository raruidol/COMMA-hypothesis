F1	[2023/05/17 16:06:41 GMT+0000]: Oh, my God, I'm so confused. I'm just going good old-fashioned…

M2:	Four zero seven.

F1:	…assumptions and accusations. 

M2:	Gut feeling. 

F1:	Gut feeling.

F1:	Oh, yeah. Yeah. She was… But I think the two of them were in it together.

M1:	Yeah. Sure. But then if Sherry is in the back yard creating a scene, it's not her.

F1	[00:01:21]: He's there.
