Part 29:

F1 [2023/05/12 19:23:07 GMT+0000]:	Like, we're not actually necessarily looking for a weapon, if he died from a fall.

F2:	Yeah. And like, you'd like to think they wouldn't say it was a fall if it was obviously, like, a wound from a weapon. It's like gunshot wounds, yes, it was definitely a fall.

F1:	But he just fell over, you know, straight onto the bullets. Okay. Yeah. So, yeah, I would say that she went to his house to cover for him to make it seem like they were both in.

F2:	Yeah. But he's the only that's…

F1:	But he wasn't actually there.

F2:	…probably not accounted for.

F1:	Yeah, which is why she had to let herself in, instead of, like, just ringing the doorbell or whatever.

F2:	Uh-huh.

F1:	Yeah. Can you see anything else?

M1:	No. I mean, it's interesting that here he's giving the, I mean, he knew was the culprit of this stuff. And in the last will, he's been giving part of the property to Donna, and to Joan.

F1:	Yeah.

M1:	So, that's probably…the only thing is that, we maybe are missing something, I don't know. Because she went to the house, but that was at 2.30, and the murdering was after 3.30, no? So, is there some…

F1:	We don't know that she stayed there.

M1:	Yeah, we are not sure that she stayed, yeah.

F2:	Yeah.

M1:	Uh-huh. 

F1:	Yeah, and this also…

M1:	And this is like newspaper paper, hey?

F1 [00:01:23]:	Uh-huh. Yeah, and this also, like, doubly confirms that the person at the ritual was Joan, because she did that weird thing with the dead fox, she was like, this is for Vinegar Tom, and her cat was called Vinegar Tom. Yeah.
