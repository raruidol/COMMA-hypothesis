Part 88:

F2:	[2023/05/16 18:06:36 GMT+0000] Oh, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, H.

F1:	Yeah, like this doesn't make any sense.

F3:	Have you tried the other direction, forward?

	Four forward?

F1:	Or it could start with seven O four or something. 'Cause I think so far they've all been in one direction.

F2:	Did you write that on there, did you write that?

F3:	No.

F1:	No, no, this was on here, which is where we got this from.

F3:	Yeah.

F1:	Well let's try seven back from D.

	Could you…?

F2:	Oh sorry. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, W. Or that could be a Y.

F3:	Guess.

F2:	Y's W and what's H, how many back from…?

F1:	Seven, four back from D.

F2:	One, two, three, four, oh back to a Z.

F1:	Zero doesn't make sense either, 'cause that would be D.

F2:	So this is the only clue we haven't solved.

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	I think it's Chris who killed him. I mean, I think he's like the most straightforward and most obvious. Chris killed him and then because Cherie asked him.

F2:	So here's a question. So, if we think that, maybe the clue's in the F. So maybe if it's F…

F1:	Oh, we know F is, if it was from Cherie, it'll be a C.

F3:	Oooh.

F2:	If this is from…

F1:	Because they're letters they wrote to each other, right?

F3:	[00:01:00]: Yeah.
