Part 26:

M1	[2023/05/17 15:47:07 GMT+0000]: We're very chaotic.

F1:	Yeah, we're doing this chaotically, but it's our first time at this, so…

M1:	Old Scratch Tavern is on…is a country road…a county…county road, 66. So what was the other road you were just talking about? You mentioned…

F1:	Perdition. Perdition? No. Carmichael.

M1:	Carmichael. Okay. 

F1:	Carmichael Road.

M1:	Okay. 

F1:	Okay. This is the…now the police officer. He's one of the suspects.

M1:	Yes. 

F1:	So… Okay. He's very outdoorsy. Carmen went to talk to him at the sheriff's officer, on the Tuesday. Okay, that's before the death. Right. He confirmed… Oh, no, that's after the death.

M1:	Or after. Yeah. 

F1:	Sorry. He confirmed…

M1:	Which Tuesday is this? But yeah.

F1:	He confirmed Nick's blood alcohol level wasn't off the charts. He was tipsy but not seriously impaired. When she pressed him for more information he told me details aren't being made available to the public, said Nick's death was tragic but accidents just sometimes happen. Then Carmen goes to his home and he seemed annoyed but he let her in, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and… Oh, snooped around a bit while he was in the kitchen getting plates and stole an opened envelope, which was at the bottom of the pile of mail on the table. What's the envelope? I think that's that envelope.

M1:	So that will be that envelope. 
[00:00:53: Yeah.
