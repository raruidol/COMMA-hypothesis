Part 37:


F3:	[2023/05/16 16:50:40 GMT+0000] Guys, this is weird, Donna left the bar one hour before the closing. At 3.30 there's the CCTV footage, so it doesn't mean the bar closed at 4?

F2:	Well, we've got that she was the last person to leave, and she left, we thought, we put 2.30, 'cause…?

F3:	Yeah.

F1:	But I mean, so this could have been after the bar was already closing, right, because it's just staff in the staffroom… 

F3:	Yeah, but if Donna left at 3.30, she was like, driving and she just left.

F1:	So we assumed 2.30.

F2:	Oh we've got…yeah, we made it 2.30.

F3:	Yeah, but then there's a big time. 

F1:	Yeah, so…

F3:	Aha, okay. So 3.31 Donna sighting.

F1:	Okay. I think that's 401, collision between blue Cadillac and a black Lincoln.

F3:	401, collision. Let's see, eraser.

F2:	A blue what?
