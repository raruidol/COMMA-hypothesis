F1:	[2023/05/16 16:21:33 GMT+0000] Someone said, oh, that's what the noise was around 2.30, maybe…

F2:	Ah, 2,30, oh yeah, yeah, that is…

F1:	At 2.30 someone heard noise, and then they're assuming it's this, but it could have actually been to do with the murder.

F2:	Ah, that might be the important bit. There's a clue in there, and I think you're right, I think it's that one.

	Who said that actually, who's the…Helen, 'cause she might come back.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	So she might be just complaining about a neighbour, and this person's provided us with a clue.

F1:	Yeah, so if you're doing a detailed timeline with times on that day, around 2.30 a noise was made as well, if you want to add that in?

F3:	So I'm going to put here, December 7, and that would be 4.47, that's when Mia came back.

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	Four forty seven am, Mia 

[00:00:59]: [inaudible]. And then so this is, 9.27, so I guess somewhere here we'll have, what time was it, 2…? 

F2:	Two thirty was the noise.

F2:	Two, so that would be December, 7, 2.30.

F1:	Yeah, a noise was heard by Helen Garbinstky.

F3:	Noise…Helen, I'll just do Helen G so…

F1:	[00:01:10]: Yeah, so we've got a letter that's on Old Scratch Tavern printed paper.
