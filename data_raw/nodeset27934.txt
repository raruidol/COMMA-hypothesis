F1:	[2023/05/16 17:14:59 GMT+0000] But hopefully that helps with that?

F2:	Well, I've not been able to break it, but let's say that is an S. Someone's…

F1:	D, D, O…

F2:	It hasn't made sense to me, any of them, but [inaudible] 

	[00:02:16]: code, we've now learned how to interpret, and you'd say that's an S.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	So when we see a U, that's an S. S…

F1:	A U is S.

F2:	S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, okay.

F1:	So that wouldn't be this one, do any of these go U to S? 

	Oh no, but we need to do it again, yeah.

F2:	Well, so if that is it, then that's D…so if U is an S, then it's up and a D is a B, B…

F1:	O?

F2:	O…B, B, O…but that…

F1:	What does O become?

F2:	O becomes N.

F1:	B, B, N apostrophe S.

F2:	But that could be someone's name so…

F1:	Yeah, let's keep going. Z?

F2:	B. Oh I'm going up aren't I? Sorry, Z is X. 

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Mmm, it's not looking good.

F1:	B?

F2:	[00:02:46]: B is Z. No, it's not no, shit.
