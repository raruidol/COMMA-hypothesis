Part 15
F2 [2023/05/12 18:53:30 GMT+0000]:	Uh-huh. I was just going to say, the last point on Chris, is saying that he showed up at the house, and was banging on the door, and accusing of theft, and threatening to press charges. So, it sounds like he really did not want that letter to be found.

M1:	Hmm. But no, but would, like the guy from the agency stole it, it's not a, like a sheet from the notebook, or it's a letter?

F2:	I think it's just the envelope.

M1:	Like just the envelope, okay, I misunderstood it, then.

F2:	Yeah, because it says that, they visited him at home, and brought pizza, and then was snooping around in the kitchen, and stole an opened envelope that was at the bottom of the pile of mail on the table.

M1:	Ah, okay.

F2:	So, I think that's what he's then accusing of stealing, but it doesn't actually specify that.

M1:	Okay.

F1:	So, I just noticed something weird. So, the police officers says that they, when they went to Cherie, they made sure that she called her mother, to get her mother to come down and stay with her, so she wouldn't be alone. But, here, she hasn't called her mother, and instead, this guy is there. It's very suspicious.

M1:	The guy is, where?

F2:	Where is this?

F1:	So, the wife, so the police officer says that, they told Cherie that he had been murdered, and then they said, they made sureâ€¦

M1:	He, you mean, Nick?

F1:	Yeah. So, yeah, she's his wife. The police officer broke the news and told her, and they know she did it.

F2:	I've just realised, Cherie says that she was staying at a friend's house the night Nick died, so she could be the one that was at Chris' house.

M1:	Oh, that's true, that's true, yeah, that's true.

F1:	Yeah, so that also means that there's some kind of motive involved, possibly. Okay.

F2:	And she also denies that it was a murder.

F1:	Convenient.

F2 [00:01:28]:	Yeah.
