Part 77: 
F2:	[2023/05/16 17:53:30 GMT+0000] I think we can believe this, 'cause it was a real car.

	It was a real car, the other ones I don't think we can believe, 'cause there's no evidence, he could have just written them down. 

F3:	So the Donna's one, yeah, and then, so this is the, I mean the early ones we can also believe, right? But the collision between the blue and the silver car at four, we don't know about? 

F2:	Yeah, there's no evidence for that one. 

F3:	No. So the things before, that's fine, [inaudible] 

[00:00:22]: on here. 
F2:	Is there anything, we've got a clue which we haven't worked out? 
F1:	There's… 
F3:	Also because at 3.30, the bar-keep was still in the bar, so at 3.31 Chris could have been doing whatever, it's fine. 
F2:	I'd say with his boot, 'cause this is Chris's boot, these aren't work boots, he would have changed them, he must have had his car, to have changed his boots on the night, or [inaudible]

[00:00:49]:, 'cause he didn't wear his police boots. 
F3:	Okay, so like a quick question? Do we think it's Donna? 
F2:	Or why do we think…? 
F3:	Or wait, no, do we think it's Joan. Do we think it's the witch? 
F1:	No. 
F2:	No, you wouldn't kill for losing a cat, and it wasn't even him that killed the cat. 
F1:	Like, I think the weird stuff was her getting revenge for the cat, but 

[00:01:04]: I don't think it's related to the murder.
