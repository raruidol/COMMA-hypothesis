Part 14:

M1	[2023/05/17 15:28:04 GMT+0000]: I realise it's not an escape room, but still.

F1:	Okay. Donna Goddard…

M2:	That would be easy. Is this double D?

M1:	Yes. Sorry. Yes. 

F1	[00:00:13]: [Inaudible]. She was the last person to leave the bar the night Nick died. She seemed on edge, but when I asked her if everything was okay she shrugged it off, left a note on her menu and a matchbox on the counter for Nick. But he never got a chance to see it. 

	Right. This is back to Donna Goddard again. So she's the one that gets the ticket with the car.

M2:	Mmm.

F1:	With the car. And these are… Is this the information from Carmen?

M1:	This is what we got from our colleague 
[00:00:54]: [voices overlap] person.

F1:	Oh, yeah. Right. Okay. Okay. Yeah, this is Carmen's notes, I think.

M1:	So the matchbox we've got, with…

F1:	Right. She handled the sale of the bar when Nick bought it in 2005. His father opened 
[00:01:11]: [it in '57?], very involved around time, last person to leave the bar, left an hour before closing, she…late for her, seemed on edge, but when I asked if everything was okay she shrugged it off, she'd left a note on her menu, and a matchbox on the counter for Nick. Right. 
[00:01:29]: We need to talk.
