F3:	[2023/05/16 16:36:38 GMT+0000] '…Carmen's notes.

F2:	Carmen's notes. And that was the night, sorry just to clarify, that was the night he died, he gave that to her, according to Carmen's notes?

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	So did they say Donna left the bar one hour before the closing time?

F1:	Yeah, 'The last person to leave the bar at the night, Nick [inaudible]

[00:00:30]: had left an hour before closing time, which is late for her. Left a note for Nick, but he never got the chance to see it.'

F2:	The worst thing she's done in all of this, is she's a Real Estate Agent, and we always think they are the murderers. 

F1:	But she seems very suspicious of something.

F2:	Yeah, she almost seems on his side though, don't you think?

F3:	I think it doesn't matter, let's keep on going doing the timeline.

F1:	Okay, so then we've got Joan Campbell, who…

F3:	That's the witchy lady.

F1:	Well, the Save Devil's Well Foundation lady, we don't know if she's the witch but…

F3:	I'm hypothesising.

F1:	Yes. She lives on County Road.

F3:	Oh, is it all in America?

F2:	Yes.

F1:	Oh, so she lives on the same road that the bar's on, County Road. Background check, there was an arrest for assault, the charges were dropped. Arrest for trespassing, charges were dropped. 

[00:00:57]: And a one no contest divorce.
