F1 [2023/05/12 18:55:00 GMT+0000]:	Yeah, so like, where is her mother?

F2:	That's a good question. 

F1:	Like…

F2:	Yeah, I just noticed, as well, on Donna's one, it's saying that they tried to call her and there was no answer, they called her office and they said she left on a business trip, not sure when she's supposed to get back. But she was supposed to be meeting Nick on the Wednesday.

F1:	So, but that could be that she, like if she felt like she had to warn him about something, and then he got murdered, that she was like, I'm not going back.

F2:	Yeah.
F1:	And she's probably in the clear because of…

M1:	Who is, she?

F1:	Donna is probably clear…

M1:	Donna.

F1:	…because of the 3.30 parking thing.

M1:	Yeah, the police stuff, yeah.

F2:	Uh-huh.

F1:	Yeah, okay, so I feel like Chris and Cherie are now looking the most suspicious.

F2:	Yeah. I think that they both…

M1:	And with Joan, we know from these that she was not in the, at this event.

F1:	Yeah.

M1:	But that was close to the murder scene.

F1:	Yeah. So, it was close, but the woman reported on it also said she heard something else in the distance around half three. So, that…

M1:	In the social network?

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	So, which seems to me that, whoever, like Nick and the murderer is what she heard.

M1:	Yeah.

F2:	Uh-huh.

F1 [00:01:00]:	At the same time that she could see Joan, so it wasn't her.
