F1 [2023/05/17 15:00:00 GMT+0000]: No. I learned everything I know about bartending boss, Nick Webster. So – wait a minute – okay. So he is the victim. Nick Webster. Is there anything about him? He taught me how to pull a pint, he helped me rearrange…blah, blah, blah. He even helped me rearrange my work schedule so that I could be home more where my sister was sick last year. Nick was the best. Old Scratch Tavern isn't much to look at, but it's one of those places that feels like home. That was all Nick.

	Nick died in December, sudden, bizarre, official story was he was drunk and lost his footing, but too many strange things happened in the months leading up to his death. Nick had been seeing the devil. Okay. For months he'd be telling anyone who'll listen there was someone or something lurking in the woods behind the bar.

M1:	So the…off the Old Scratch Tavern, the menu and such, the logo is also a devil.

F1:	Okay. Okay. At first everyone is thinking he's exaggerating. Nick could spend the whole night in a corner booth spinning yarns, there is no way he can make up this creepy blah, blah, blah, or dead animal…make up creepy notes he was getting, or dead animals on his doorstep. Where's that creepy note? What does it say?

M2:	Interlopers will be banished to the bottom of the Devil's Well.

M1:	So Devil's Well, Devil's Well. And there's something about Devil's Well on there as well. Yeah.

M2	[00:09:15]: Devil's well.
