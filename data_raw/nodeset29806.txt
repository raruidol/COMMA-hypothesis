Part 30:

F3 [2023/05/12 19:24:55 GMT+0000]: Are you giving your final answer?

M1: We have to give one name, no?

F3: I don't know.

M1: I mean, we are pretty sure about two of them, but who is the actual murderer?

F1: Erm, I would be willing to say that it was Chris.

M1: Yeah, me too, but…

F2: Yeah.

F1: But I'd be willing to say that, like, if pushed, I would say – ha-ha, if pushed – him, by himself. Because, where has the thing gone…

M1: So, what do we have to say, what's the output of this stuff?

F2: Do we just tell you our guess?

F3: I guess, yeah. So, like, why, who, how, I guess.

M1: So, it's a name?

F3: Yeah.

F2: Uh-huh.

M1: One unique name?

F1: I'm saying, Chris.

F3: I haven't seen the answers, so I don't know.

F2: Yeah.

F1: I'm saying, Chris.

M1: Okay.

F2 [00:01:05]: Uh-huh.
