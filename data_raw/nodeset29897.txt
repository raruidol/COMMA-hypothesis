F3:	[2023/05/16 16:55:08 GMT+0000] So did all the weird shit until 4:47 with Mia, and then she kept on doing weird shit without Mia.

F2:	Oh, did she say what time she found the body, 'cause that would be quite good?

F3:	Six am.

F1:	'Stated she was out for a walk shortly after six, when she discovered the body on the rocks, beside the waterfall, and I telephoned to call police, yeah.'

F2:	Okay, that doesn't tell us anymore.

F1:	Yeah. '10:22, back to scene, search of water underway, haven't found much so far, besides some empty beer bottles, probably just littering.'

	'Eleven seventeen, gave up victim to McGinty,' so is he the sheriff? I think so.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	Yeah, sheriff, Paul McGinty. He agrees with accident scenario, will proceed accordingly. 

	Twelve thirty-two coroner, okayed removal of remains. [Morti?]

	[00:00:42]: from Bogg's Funeral Home, to pick up. 

	Thirteen oh five, told Cheri, she took it about as expected. Did my best to calm her down, reassured her foul play unlikely. Made sure she called her mother to come down and stay, so she's not alone at a time like this. Okay.

F2:	So what do you think the interesting facts in that report are, the time of body's the best one, the time of death.

F1:	[00:01:02]: Yeah.
