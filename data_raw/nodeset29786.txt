F1 [2023/05/12 18:30:01 GMT+0000]:	So, where is the…oh, yeah, okay, hang on, oh hang on, okay. So, Nancy, whoever Nancy is. So, I wonder if, what's his name, the dead guy…

F2:	Yeah, Nick.

M1:	Nick.

F1:	…Nick, was he possibly cheating on his wife?

F2:	I was wondering that, and I was wondering why Carmen is the one who knows everything, and has all the notes. 

F1:	So, you see, she, so do we know where he lives? Oh, maybe the address is in the wife's…

F2:	Yeah, it'll be the wife's address.

F1 :	No, she lives in [inaudible].

F2:	Okay.

M1:	And what's this?

F2:	I don't know. I was going to say, though, if I can find it again…yeah, so Donna is the one who left the note on the menu, and a matchbox on the counter. But he didn't actually see them.

F1:	Oh, so where's that?

F2:	There, just the fourth bullet-point. And she says [voices overlap].

F1 :	Ah, okay. So, this is her, so this is Donna...

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	…p.m.., next Wednesday.

F2:	I'm assuming that's, like, the code we need to break, is what's on the menu.

M1:	So, this was left by Donna?

F2 [00:01:58]:	Yes.
