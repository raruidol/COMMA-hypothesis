Part 8
F1 [2023/05/12 18:32:00 GMT+0000]:	Well, it sounds like she knows some kind of secret.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	So, we need to talk about Devil's Well, about the land on Devil's Well, on Wednesday, at 11p.m.

F2:	Yeah.

M1:	Okay.

F1:	So, maybe she was planning…

M1:	So, they talked, there was time, they met in the bar, and they talked about that?

F2:	No, she left the note, I think. Yeah, so, she left a note on her menu, and the matchbox on the counter for Nick, but he never got the chance to see it.

M1:	Oh, okay. But he says that, he knows who's behind the threats, and everything?

F2:	Yeah.

M1:	Okay.

F1:	So, maybe multiple people were threatening him, and she knows about a different one?

F2:	Yeah.

M1:	Where did you get the coding stuff? I remember there was a paper.

F2:	Yeah.

F1:	Oh, yeah, but I think it was basically just explaining that you moved the alphabet.

F2:	But should we just do it to see what it actually says, in case there's anything useful?

F1:	Yeah.

M1:	Yeah.

F2:	Is this the threatening note, or…?

F1:	Yeah, so that's the threatening note on the poster.

M1:	Yeah, I wrote it down, here.

F1:	Oh, good.

M1:	But the thing is that we don't know because…okay.

F1:	Okay, so we need something…okay. Right, can I…oh.

M1:	Yes, I was going to use it.

F1:	Oh, okay. Do we have another page? I can rip my page up, because I would also like to try it.

M1:	Do you have one more paper?

F3 [00:01:25]:	I can get some.
