F1:	[2023/05/16 16:25:30 GMT+0000] 'For months he'd been telling anyone who'd listen, that there was someone or something lurking out in the woods behind the bar. At first, everyone assumed he was just exaggerating, but for the sake of a good story, Nick could spend the whole night in a corner, both spinning yarns and telling tales. But there's no way he could be making up the creepy notes he was getting, or the dead animals on the doorstep, or the fires that kept flaring up near the building.'

	So dead animals on the doorstep, we know there was a witch getting people dragging foxes and things.

F2:	There was dead animals, creepy notes, and what was the third thing he was getting?

F1:	Fires that kept flaring up near the building.

	'So he had no reason to make it up, not when things were getting so dangerous, someone was trying to scare him, maybe even scare him to death. He was obsessed with figuring out who was to blame. He'd say in the bar's office for hours, poring over the security camera footage and scribbling notes. 

	On the night he died, I'd just closed up when he came out of the office, and said he'd finally figured it out.' Interesting.

F3:	On the night he died, so that was Friday 6th.

F2:	Andâ€¦

F3:	Did it say when?

F1:	'On the night he died, no, I'd just closed up, when he came out of the office and said he'd finally figured it out.'
