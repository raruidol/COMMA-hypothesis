Part 95:

F1:	[2023/05/16 18:16:48 GMT+0000] Yeah, I don't think, I think it's fine. Who do you think it is? F3:	So the thing is, something weird about the Donna, she was there. She was there one hour later, like after she left the bar. Right? F1:	Yeah. F3:	Can I get the letter? No, the letter from… F2:	Just to go back to Donna, the night Nick died, she said, she was…'Having a rough time that night, was preoccupied with some work problems, and then I decided to go for a drive to try and clear my thoughts, but it only got worse for me.' That's probably why she got nicked. F3:	What is it…doesn't… F2:	Then she says, 'When I asked her about the stuff at the bar, she got really [antsy?]

F2:	Yeah, because she was feeling anxious. F3:	Okay, and then she went back? F2:	But I think she's… F1:	It might have just been on her way home though, or like 

[00:00:42]: she might have just been driving past it.
