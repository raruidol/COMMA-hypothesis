F2:	[2023/05/16 16:45:45 GMT+0000] Yes, funny how similar it is.

F1:	Yeah, very similar.

F2:	Oh I see, we're looking…

F3:	So I think either they repeated almost like the same, yeah.

F2:	Yeah, slightly, it's not quite the same story, but yeah, okay. I was just thinking the inconsistency.

F1:	Yeah, okay. 'Visited him at home, seemed annoyed at first, but let be in. Probably didn't hurt that I brought pizza. Snooped around a bit while he was in the kitchen getting plates and stole an opened envelope that was at the bottom of a pile of mail on the table.'

	We should probably find the envelope. This thing.

	'Also he talked about hobbies. He is in the Hiking Club too apparently, he said he's been helping Cherie with some stuff around the house.'

	So Cherie…

F2:	Oh we've had Cherie.

F3:	Wife.

F1:	Is the wife of Nick Webster. 

F2:	Mmm.

F1:	'Just trying to be a friend in her time of need.' Ooh, interesting, okay.

F2:	Did she take it out, or did he give it to her?

F1:	She stole it.

F2:	Okay, yeah, okay.

F1:	'On my way out, took a peek into his car, noticed something that might be useful? 

	Okay, we'll see. 'Ran into him at the Limestone Diner, gave me a bunch of platitudes about moving on with your life, as if he has any idea what I'm going through? After he was done condescending to me, he went to pay his bill, and left his pocket notebook sitting on the table. 

	[00:01:15]: I couldn't resist tearing out a page, too bad I couldn't get more.'
