F3:	[2023/05/16 17:28:00 GMT+0000] So this is like [inaudible]

	[00:00:01]:, no, where does it start? Here, October 13, rock through back window, nothing on cams, two fires, fire department thinks I'm crazy, find out when darling's anniversary present will be ready. So he's thinking about his wife. Fire near parking lot, cam only. One racoon, below cam loading dock, see the devil in the woods, but I'm just not fast enough. Three fires in the woods tonight, no signs on my cams. Biggest fire yet, this was a close one, remember to pick up darling's gift. [inaudible]

	[00:00:32]: don't be late for dinner, reservation tomorrow, don't want a repeat of last year, so there's some troubles in the paradise.

F1:	Okay, yeah.

F2:	Remember, he had to sleep in the pub or something?

F1:	Yeah, for a week after he forgot the anniversary. Yeah.

F3:	A note in the mailbox, 'you'll burn for what you've done'. So this is like, this weird shit is definitely the witch. Fire by the loading dock, a burnt wall pretty bad, still no structural damage. Prints, though the devil's.

F1:	Okay, did you…?

F3:	I couldn't find them, I couldn't match them. I think it's…it could be these ones, but I don't, there's nothing really.

F1:	It could be these. Let me have a quick look, just so I know what's in here.

F3:	Yeah.

	These are the same ones that are on the photo.

F1:	Okay. Is this…?

F3:	I don't know where it's from.

F1:	Okay. Yeah, this isn't very clear, so that'll be hard to match. 

	It looks like there's something in the middle?

F3:	No, I think it's those ones. Wait, I think it's the same ones. But I'm not sure about these ones, matching these, but this is I'm pretty sure.

F1:	It looks quite triangly though? [01:30:00] Is there nothing that…?

F3:	See?

F1:	Yeah. This doesn't look like this.

F3:	No.

F1:	[00:01:12]: It doesn't look like that.
