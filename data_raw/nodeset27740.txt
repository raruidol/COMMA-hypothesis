Part 11
F1 [2023/05/12 18:41:30 GMT+0000]:	So, if it was, then that would be, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, plus nine.

F2:	Yeah. So, will we try that?

F1:	So, one, two, three, four, five, six…no.

F2:	No.

F1:	Let's see, so let's see. What would the relationship between U and D would be…five, six, seven, eight, nine, plus S, would be minus two, that would be minus one. So, it would be…

M1:	Okay, so this was not relevant.

F1:	No.

F2:	Is it just like more instructions, or just like…

F1:	It's just a practice.

M1:	Yeah, it says, when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, might be the truth. Very beautiful, but it doesn't look like…

F1:	So, what was this one, then? I'm just going to…plus. What are you thinking? You look like you're actually writing something down.

M1:	Yes, yes, but no, it's just trying. Because, in English, after the apostrophe, it's an R, and then…?

F1:	But the R, I think the R should always have an E, as well, RE.

M1:	Hmm.

F1:	Yeah, and like, it seems cruel to also have spelling mistakes in there.

M1:	Yeah, yeah, no, I don't think, I don't think.

F1:	But the only things, the only ones we could think of, none of them work. Unless we're forgetting a letter. Like, yeah, S, T, and D are the only ones we could think of, but those don't work for the other letters. Okay, this was meant to, like, like help us cheat, but it's actually not working. Not cheat, but you know. Oh, that's interesting, okay, ooh. 

F2:	What's this, what are you looking for?

F1:	It is…okay. So, Chris lives on Carmichael Road, so he's the one who had a girlfriend sneak in really late, on that night. 

F2 [00:01:55]:	Uh-huh.
