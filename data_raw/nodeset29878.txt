It looked like she'd been crying a lot. We talked afterwards, just reminiscing. She said something really odd, like, if only I'd been faster, maybe I could have made a difference.'

F2:	So who was that that left that, just to make sure, I've got a Post It Note.

F1:	Donna Goddard.

F2:	'Cause I'll put that one, so we don't have to remember it for long.

F1:	Yeah.

	'Before I could ask her what she meant, Nolan came over and started telling him about a job opening for a fry cook at [inaudible] 

[00:00:56]: Diner. He was grateful for the lead, we've all been struggling to find work since Old Scratch closed. It's hard to believe we'll ever find another job as great.'

	'I went over to her house, hoping I could talk to her about the night Nick died. She said she'd been having a rough time that night, was preoccupied with some work problems.'

	'Then I decided to go over for a drive, and clear my thoughts, but it only got worse from there. When I asked about the stuff she left at the bar, she got really anxious and said, we shouldn't talk here, and hustled me out of the house in a hurry.'

F2:	Oh. 

F1:	'Tried to call her, no answer. Called her office, and they said she left on a business trip, not sure when she's supposed to get back.'

F2:	So, but this meeting on the menu, could have happened, that was his notes?

F3:	No, this is not his notes, this isâ€¦

F1:	[00:01:23]: This is like Carmen's notes.
