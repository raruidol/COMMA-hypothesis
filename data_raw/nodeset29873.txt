F1:	[2023/05/16 16:27:40 GMT+0000] Let's see, okay?

	'I took the evidence round to the sheriff hoping it would change his mind, but he didn't care that Nick really was chasing after someone that night. The official determination is still that Nick slipped and fell of the cliff, but the thing is, I went out to the place where he died, and I don't think the authorities have even bothered to look any further than the spot where they found Nick's body.

	There was caution tape down on the rocks, but nothing on top of the cliff.'

F2:	What's she saying about, they didn't evenâ€¦can I see that sentence?

	'They didn't bother to look any further than the spot where they found Nick's body.

	Okay, so they haven't investigated the area. 

F1:	So she's saying, 'Caution tape on the rocks, but nothing up at the top of the cliff, near the ledge. It didn't look like it had been disturbed since Saturday night, and if the authorities had been there, there's no way they'd count out foul play. Someone in a devil mask really was there that night, and whoever it was, pushed Nick off that cliff.

	The sheriff may not believe me, but I must be making someone nervous by looking into Nick's death. 

[00:02:20]: I've started to get threatening letters, just like the ones Nick was getting before he died. I'd be lying if I said I'm not scared, but those threats also prove I'm onto something, don't you think?'

F2:	She should be. I think so.

F1:	'I know I'm close, but I've got questions I can't answer. I'm sending you all the evidence I've collected in the hope that you'll be able to do what I can't, and bring my friend's killer to justice before it's too late. 

[00:02:37]: Sincerely, Carmen.
