Part 21:

F1	[2023/05/17 15:39:05 GMT+0000]: Well, I'll read this to myself. Running out 
[00:00:01]: [inaudible] with a bunch of strangers. I can't make the ritual. So I end up going 
[00:00:09]: [and it's?] totally bonkers. I got there, like, at three in the morning. That he got murdered at half three. No. Yeah. Yeah, right. Listen.

	She's put something in on the 7th of December at 4:47am, this is after he's killed. This is Mia. So I wind up going myself and it was totally bonkers, I got there at, like, three in the morning, it was just me and this lady with a basket of weird herbs. She's got… She is a bee farmer that sells honey. 
[00:00:40]: [Yes?], I know it's not herbs, but…

M1	[00:00:42]: [It's close enough?].

F1:	We spent, like, 30 to 40 minutes burning herbs and chanting. At one point I heard something crashing around in the under-bush and I got worried she'd actually summoned something, but I guess it was just an animal. Then she hands me the shovel [0:40:00] and tells…shuffle, shovel…and tells me to start walking. I thought she was going to kill me, instead she made me pick up a dead fox off the side of the highway and carry it over to this old dive bar. She made me put the fox on the ground by the mailbox, and then she covered it with ashes 
[00:01:12]: [and yelled?] for Vinegar Tom, whatever that means. After that she thanked me for helping support the cause. Anyway, I guess perdition has its very own witch. 
[00:01:23]: Oh, that's boring.
