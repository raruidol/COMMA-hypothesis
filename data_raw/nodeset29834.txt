Part 35:

M1	[2023/05/17 16:00:36 GMT+0000]: That's a woman's shoe. That's one of the suspects live at something that ends in a number two for an address. So that's number…

F1:	That's four oh seven.

M1:	Four oh seven.

F1:	She's 
[00:00:27]: [inaudible] oh five. She's two County Road.

M1:	Yeah, so two County Road. So I think the implication here is that Joan only owns one pair of shoes that she ever uses.

F1:	Okay.

M1:	And so therefore it shouldn't be her.

F1:	Okay.

M1:	Maybe. Because these are not the right shoes. It's 
[00:00:45]: [voices overlap]…

F1:	And we think…and we think Joan was being crazy.

M1:	Against the government. And Nick was as well.

F1:	Yeah. And she was…

M1:	So they were on the same side. 

F1:	Yeah, they were on the same side. And she was out doing herbs and stuff with that Leah…

M1:	All right. 

F1:	…at the same time. So I think we definitely rule Joan out. Donna got a ticket at the time of death, though. 

M2:	Where was that?

M1:	But that's possible. Right? To get a ticket?

F1:	Yeah, that is possible, to get a ticket. So…

M2:	Do we have the exact time of death?

M1:	No, that…

F1:	Three to four hours before…

M1:	So half three to…

F1:	Seven, half seven. Three, four hours before.

M1	[00:01:06]: Yeah.
