F1:	[2023/05/16 16:57:15 GMT+0000] Well we thought she'd left about an hour earlier. 
F3:	Yeah, she didn't, we messed up. 
F1:	No, but it said, an hour before closing. 
F3:	Yeah, but the… 
F1:	I guess we don't specifically know when closing was. 
F3:	Oh, you're right. 
F2:	Why would we write 2:30 if we didn't know it? I think we must have… 
F1:	Because we assumed 3:30 here, it was shut.

	[00:00:25]: [voices overlap] 
F2:	…written an hour before. It makes me think we… 
F3:	No, no, an hour's correct, I think she did, it sounded like she left that early.
F1:	'Last person at the bar the night Nick died, left maybe an hour before closing time, which is late for her.' 
F2:	Yeah. 
F3:	And that is probably the closing time, that's, yeah, we assume that this is closing time. 
F1:	Right. 
F2:	So she left the pub at 2:30, but yet she was in the car at 3:30 without her lights on? 
F3:	Yeah. 
F1:	On the street, so it was weird. 
F2:	Of the bar. 
F1:	Aha. 
F2:	So she could have been, actually she was on the street, and he saw something at that time, I mean it could be her. She's… 
F1:	She could be the devil that's taunting him, although that's weird, but maybe. 
F3:	Okay. So… 
F2:	And so we think, there's a possibility that Donna, and Donna's the Estate Agent, isn't she? 
F1:	[00:00:59]:Yeah.
