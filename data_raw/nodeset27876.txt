F2:	[2023/05/16 17:38:23 GMT+0000] We couldn't solve it until we'd got the bloody thing open. Ooh.

F1:	Right, okay.

F2:	Okay.

F1:	E, back four.

F2:	E back four.

	What is this, so, if we move E back four, we get V, is that what you're saying? No, we get A.

F1:	A? Okay.

F3:	[00:00:22]: [inaudible].

F2:	Say that again, E back four?

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	One, two, three, if you go back four, oh sorry…

F3:	[00:00:30]: [inaudible].

F1:	One, two, three four, yeah, so A. That's fine.

	So I'm writing it, that's fine. Can you move F back seven?

F2:	F, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, Y.

	Does that make sense?

F1:	That doesn't seem right, no.

F2:	So F back seven?

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Yeah.

F3:	Does it make sense?

F1:	Oh no, that does make sense, that's fine. X back four.

F2:	X, one, two, three, four…T.

F1:	And then T back seven.

F2:	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven N.

	Is it making any sense at all?

F1:	I think so. And then I back four.

F2:	I? One, two, three, four, E.

F1:	Any time, I feel like this should be an M, but…

F2:	Yeah, well it could be. It doesn't really matter as long as we get the sentence, yeah.

F1:	It's fine, yeah. Right, 407, 407, 40…P back seven.

F2:	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, I?

F1:	[00:01:37]: W back four.
