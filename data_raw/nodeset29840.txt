Part 33:

F1	[2023/05/17 15:58:10 GMT+0000]: And so…and she's definitely like, oh, we need to get rid of him, to Chris. But then she creates an alibi. And he does it. She creates an alibi by going and making a big…

M1:	Ah, on purpose. 

F1:	…loud noise somewhere else. 

M1:	Mmm.

F1:	And like it's both of them there. But actually he's bloody pushed him off a cliff. And he's…that's why he's wanting to…

M2:	It's him. 
[00:00:20]: [Voices overlap] him.

F1:	It's him. I think we…

M1:	It's him. But why? I mean, we need to establish that is the case.

F1:	Well, his means is that…he's a bloody police officer.

M2:	Mmm. 

F1:	And he can go where he likes and do what he likes without being questioned. I think that's what's happened, because this could go on.

M1:	But…okay. So that you got something about having a peek through the back window of a car. Right? 

F1:	Yeah.

M1:	So we have a photo of that.

M2:	Where was that?

F1:	That was Carmen, the woman who's bring the complaint to the detective agency. And she says…

M1:	Does it say what type of car it was?

F1:	…oh, he's into hiking. Ran into her…where was that? Oh, wait a minute. Visited him at home, seemed annoyed at first, let me in. Then she finds the envelope. 
[00:01:08]: Just on my way out I took a peek into his car and noticed something that might be useful.
