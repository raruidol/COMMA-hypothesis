Part 54:

F2:	[2023/05/16 17:12:58 GMT+0000] Okay, so this letter, D, D, O…D… F3:	I assume that's the location of the murder? F1:	Yeah, probably, right. F3:	[Inaudible] 

	[00:01:09]: anything. F1:	So there was something…mmm…this Chris guy's in the hiking club, so hiking boots could be his. F3:	But they're old kind of hiking boots. F1:	Who was it that was…? Oh… F3:	LL Beans but they call it 

	[00:01:40]: [ L-Berry?] F1:	So, 'snuck onto Joan's property when I knew she'd be in town, took a picture of something that looks promising, but I'm still waiting on the results from Deviant Tracker Boot Tread Database.' So they're trying to match, so that looks like the Database. F3:	'Snuck into the property, took a picture.' Oops, I think that's just stuck to me. F2:	Ah, it doesn't make sense. F3:	'Wish I could afford the Pro Version…' What is this? F1:	This is weird…J… 

	So this one is going from the bottom up, by the way, so the coded letter to the answer… F2:	Bottom up. F3:	Too many shoes, I feel like that's just a distraction. F4:	I'm just popping out. F3:	You're not allowed to leave, until we're allowed to leave. F1:	Okay, yeah, this stupid waste of time says, when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. F2:	I'm blaming Ella for that. F3:	Thank you Ella. F4:	[00:01:58]: No problem
