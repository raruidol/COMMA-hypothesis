Part 55:

M2	[2023/05/17 16:27:48 GMT+0000]: I'm just going to head off, give me a ring when you're done.
 F1:	Who do you think it…? Who do you think did it? Do you not know who…? Do you not have a firm idea? The only person out of those four suspects that I think is Chris…
 M1:	Yes. 
 F1:	…and if it's not him it's Carmen. And she…I've got that feeling. And even if we're completely wrong, well 
[00:00:20]: [voices overlap]… 
 M1:	So I agree that it would be great 
[00:00:21]: [voices overlap]. 
 M2:	So that at least the pain will be over. 
 F1:	Yeah.
 M1:	Oh, God. 
 F1:	And I think you've got what we…you were looking for, in terms of… 
 M1:	Of course. 
 F1:	…filming it, have you? 
 F2:	Absolutely. 
 F1:	Yeah? 
 M2:	More than. 
 F1:	Oh, yes. 
 M1	[00:00:33]: [Voices overlap] two, three, four. In which case then… 
 F1:	I'm more than prepared to be wrong. 
 M2:	Mmm. 
 F1:	Are you? 
 M1:	Well… 
 M2:	Better to be wrong quickly, than… 
 F1:	Mmm. 
 M2:	…right in another hour. 
 F1:	Are you getting someone, another group, to do this? Oh, my God, we're going to be in competition. That's what…that's how he needs to get it right. 
 M2:	They've already had another group do it. Right? 
 F1:	Are we the second group? 
 M1:	Yes. 
 F1:	Oh, no. 
 M2:	It's not looking good. 
 M1:	Okay. So… 
 M2:	That's kind of what I did. 
 F1:	Wait. Did the other group get it right? 
 F2:	I'm not saying. 
 F1	[00:01:13]: Right. Okay. Okay.
