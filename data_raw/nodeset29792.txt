M1 [2023/05/12 18:51:00 GMT+0000]:	And do we know those boots, who they belong to?

F1:	This one, I don't think we do know. 

M1:	But this one, we do?

F1:	We're guessing.

F2:	We're guessing.

M1:	You are guessing, okay, we don't know for sure?

F1:	No.

F2:	No.

M1:	No.

F1:	But we're guessing that this is the useful thing she saw, in his car, which is, so…

M1:	He has a Toyota?

F2:	Yes.

M1:	Okay. 

F1:	He has two cars. But one of them is a Toyota.

M1:	Okay. And these, do we know, what is this photo taken?

F2:	I think that's supposed to be like the crime scene, but I'm not sure.

M1:	Okay, so there is no information about…?

F2:	No, they were sitting with the shoe guide, but there was no other information with it.

M1:	Okay, so we have a link between this boot, which probably because it's a Toyota name on there, on the picture, and this box, because this is…?

F1:	Well, that might be a different one, that might just have been found, whereas this one, we think was left by Donna. So, like, they're separate ones, but they're the same.

M1:	And why, like, if this comes from the detective agency, who don't we have for this one?

F1:	Good question. But it might be that he dropped that one himself. Because that's his box, and this was the one from her. 

M1:	Uh-huh.

F1 [00:02:15]: Yeah, is there a…yeah, that's a good question, though.
