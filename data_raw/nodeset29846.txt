M1	[2023/05/17 16:22:26 GMT+0000]: It's him, and it's the lady that wrote us the letter. And it's at 3:30 in the morning, just before he died. And then there's a guy in a…or someone in a… 
 M2:	Devil mask. 
 M1:	…devil mask outside, grinning at them. She reported seeing him; turning around, the two of them are gone. 
 M2:	Mmm. 
 M1:	In the meantime, for some reason Joan knew this was going to happen – or Donna, or whomever, the lady who got the ticket – knew this was going to happen, and she came to try to warn him, or save him, or whatever. 
 M2:	Mmm. 
 M1:	But wait a minute. Oh, crap. No. Who is Carmen Rochas? Oh, that's the lady… Okay. Yeah. 
 M2:	Oh, my God. 
 M1:	Sorry. So yes, these…this is…these are Nick and Carmen on the photo. Yes. Okay.

 M1:	Yeah. 
 F1:	Right? 
 M2:	Which letter is this? 
 F1:	Carmen… 
 M1:	The one… 
 M2:	Oh, the other one. Yeah. 
 F1:	This is Carmen writing to the investigator. On her own headed paper now because she runs the

 M1:	Yeah. 
 M2	[00:01:28]: Yes. Exactly.
