F1: Yeah. So, okay, so U needs to be something that is, like you could have an apostrophe, so it's either, like D, S, is there anything else? F2: T. F1: T. F2: Yeah, and it's also followed there, isn't it, so it needs to be the beginning of a two letter word, as well. F1: So, like we, do, so, to. F2: Yeah. F1: So… F2: But there's a UP, and a UH, is there, at the end, there? F1: So, I'm going to guess that P is O, because that’s the only vowel that could be the second vowel in one of those words. F2: Yeah. F1: So, what did I say…O. So, that would be just one, so that would be T. Okay, so if you move about, like, one. No, that doesn't work, aagh. F2: Hmm. F1: Because otherwise it would be…okay. Is that definitely two Ds? Yeah, hmm. Oh, I wish I had a pencil. Okay, erm… F2: If we go with F, because there's VFF, so what's a three letter word that has two…? F1: Yeah, the only other thing is, I wonder, I mean, I guess it's always possible that there's more than one in there, but that seems too complicated. F2: The other thing is, are we taking the spaces as, like actual spaces, or is it just sort of like…? F1: Hmm. Probably, like, they look like they're grouped into words. F2: Yeah. F1: Yeah, I don't know, I feel like the real puzzle is, what the hell the first word is. F2: Yeah. F1: Because, like, what word starts with two of the same letter? F2 [00:40:00].: Yeah, and ends with an apostrophe, something. F1: Okay. So…no progress. Like, this seemed like a really, it was going to go somewhere. F2: Yeah. I'm just thinking, F could be O. If it's like, two, or something. F1: Yeah. F2: But I'm not sure about any of the rest of them.
