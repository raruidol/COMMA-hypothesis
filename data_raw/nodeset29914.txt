F2: [2023/05/16 17:58:04 GMT+0000] Then there'd be two of them, that's what I'm saying.

F3: Can we say two people Ella, by the rules of the game, or is it only one person?

F4: It's up to you.

F3: Okay. So I think if somebody killed the guy, it's probably going to be another guy, right, like he's stronger?

F2: Well, I think…no, why would he go and talk to someone on a ledge at the top of a…why was he up there?

F2: He could have been chasing the witch. The witch takes his mask off and pushes him over the ledge.

F1: Is he chasing someone in a devil mask or…when did he run out again?

F2: Well, that's why he ran into the forest, but that was 3.30. Oh…

F3: [00:00:30]: [voices overlap]…

F2: …could it have been the deputy turns up at 3.30 and then does all the spooky things 

[00:00:35]: [inaudible].

F1: Well the deputy stopped Donna's car at 3.31 and…

F3: At 3.31.

F1: …that was by the bar, right?

F3: Yeah.

F1: So he was near.

F2: Mmm.

F3: Yeah. I honestly don't think, like it's not Joan definitely, because she was with Mia for the most of it, so this is the time of death, and this is when Mia's last comments, when Mia came back, and that's probably the time where she was going back. 

[00:01:16]: So, there's no thing for Joan.
