Part 57: F1	[2023/05/17 16:31:34 GMT+0000]: I'm going to get this game for me and my sis… Well, yeah, and I'm going to say I've never played it before. This is on the same paper.
[00:00:22]: [Just try it out?]. I'm just… F2:	Shall I give you the instructions in the instruction book, that about the code breaking? F1:	Yeah. M2:	The ones you said made it too easy. F2:	I thought.

M1:	Oh, 
[00:01:04]: [voices overlap]?

[00:01:31]: [voices overlap]… M1:	Oh. F1:	Okay. Can we say that we think it's Carmen, but if it wasn't then it was Chris? M2:	We can. F1:	Let's say that. M2:	We're saying that. F1:	We're saying that. 
[00:01:41]: [End there?]. F2:	Okay. Decision? F1	[00:01:43]: Yes.
