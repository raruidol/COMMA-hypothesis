F1:	[2023/05/16 17:23:56 GMT+0000] This is not making any sense to me.

F3:	…so maybe repeat in a way that for every letter, you have the different thing, so this one is like +3, this is +1, this +8, and then it repeats like that.

F1:	I just tried 1, 3, 8 and it wasn't working, but maybe it's a different order. So this should be whose right?

F3:	Yeah, this is whose?

F2:	Oh yeah, whose?

F1:	And so, if we try and figure out the code from there?

F3:	Yeah, exactly.

F1:	Yeah, so it was shifting this way, B to A, so D to…

F2:	Whose?

F1:	…two, three, four, five, six, seven, shift seven, then D to H, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, it seems weird but okay. And then zero. And then U…which way was I going? One, two…

F3:	But why are you going in different directions?

F1:	Was I going in different directions or should I be?

F3:	I'm asking why you're going in different directions?

F1:	So I was going right to left, so D, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And then D again, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and then U would be two.

	I'll try it the other direction and see if that makes anymore sense. So D to W. That would be 19, 

	[00:01:50]: and then to H, one, two, three, four…
