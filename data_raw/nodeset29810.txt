F1	[2023/05/17 15:11:27 GMT+0000]: Mmm.

M1:	Those. So this is…I mean, that's got to be the code for…

F1:	Oh, okay. Oh, yeah. Month, month, year.

M1:	Quite sure.

F1:	Right. Okay. 

M1:	The question is, the date you can't forget. Don't know. Marriage? Something like that?
F1:	Okay. 

M1:	It would be strange that a year has one digit. That's very strange. 

F1:	Okay. Shall I just skim this and see if there's anything in it, instead of keep reading everything out?

M1:	Sure. Yeah. 

F1:	It's up to you. What do you think?

M2:	What's on the back?

F1:	So they're…yeah, you kind of say that's the article, but this is…

M1:	Ah, okay.

F1:	…new developments for the Devil's Well. Okay. So quickly…

M1:	So it's all related to the Devil's Well thing. You had the files, I think, about the suspects? Or not?

M2:	Yeah.

M1:	So just to see what we've got, maybe.

F1:	Okay. 

M1:	So we've got newspaper article about the accident, but also about the well development.

M2:	Mmm.

M1:	We've got a poster related…so there are lots of things related to that Devil's Well development. So there is protection of the Devil's Well. Then we have the files there with the suspects, I guess.

M2	[00:01:21]: I assume.
