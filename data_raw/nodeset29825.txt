If you live on Carmichael Road, good luck if you want to sleep through the night; I didn't get a wink because of my inconsiderate hussy of a…because my neighbour's inconsiderate hussy of a girlfriend shows up at his house at all hours to be as disruptive as possible. I swear she knocked over every single thing in the back yard. I don't know what possessed her to start playing music so late but I assume she intended to annoy him. Thankfully it stopped after a couple of hours. What time was that? 
[00:02:34]: [Well, it doesn't say?]. But not before she robbed me of my sleep. It isn't the first time they've been inappropriately loud. Oh, so that's… Ah.

	Okay. So who is the…? If we could find out who this is, this could rule out…

M1	[00:02:50]: [Her?]?

F1:	…because she turned up at my neighbour's inconsid-…my neighbour's inconsistent hussy of a girlfriend. So she was there from 2:30am for a couple of hours.

F1:	Okay. Who is this then?

M1:	So that's the…

F1:	Could this be…? No, Sherry's his wife. 

M1:	Where's the 
[00:03:34]: [menu]?

F1:	Who's Donna? Ah, no, this is somebody else that we could rule out. 
[00:03:39]: So it's another woman we could rule out.
