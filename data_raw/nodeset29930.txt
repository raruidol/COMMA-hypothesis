F2:	[2023/05/16 18:20:22 GMT+0000] So with the ticket?

F3:	Cherie is the devil, and she ran away, she just lured…

F1:	So you're agreeing that she is involved, it's just it's also Chris?

F3:	Yeah, so I think I go with Suzanne, I think Suzanne is right, Cherie lured Webster in the forest, 

[00:01:10]: I just think she's not the one who pushed him.
