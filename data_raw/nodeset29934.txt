F1:	[2023/05/16 18:32:37 GMT+0000] What are you looking for?

F3:	What did he say.

F1:	'Anytime, I wish it were just us without your old man in the way.'

F3:	Ah, aha, okay. Yeah. So I kind of think he didn't kill anyone. It kind of changes my mind. But then I agree with what Suzanne is saying. 

F1:	I don't think this is enough of an alibi to say that she actually did go away.

F2:	No, I think her alibi is, she has no alibi.

F3:	Yeah.

F1:	Yeah. Okay so she had the opportunity, because she's got no alibi.

F2:	She does ballet classes, she's quite fit. She's a gym person, she's quite fit.

F3:	Had a car. What's…

F2:	She's a gym person, she's quite fit, she can run a lot.

F3:	Aha…so…

F2:	She's a perfectionist. I think if she's a perfectionist she would not trust her sloppy boyfriend in a murder, I think she did it all herself. And she did study ballet in Indianapolis when she was 14.

F3:	This is good, I like what you're saying. 

F1:	Yeah.

F3:	So what was her car, her car was a silver Mercedes Benz, but that doesn't matter, and she borrowed the Toyota?

F2:	She definitely has no plans to re-open Old Scratch, so she made that clear.

F1:	Yeah.

F2:	So she feels, ah, she still thinks she owns it. At the funeral she said she has no plans to reopen it, so she thinks she still owns it.

F3:	[00:01:12]: Aha.
