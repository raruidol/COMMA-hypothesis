F2:	[2023/05/16 18:17:35 GMT+0000] I think the police officer gives her an alibi.

F3:	Yeah, okay, the police officer gives her an alibi, and she…

F2:	And she's quite anxious and says, we shouldn't talk here, so she knows something's afoot and dangerous. I think she's on his side, because of what's said here.

F3:	Okay.

F1:	And if we're saying…

F2:	Oh, unless it's…

F1:	…the police officer gives her an alibi, then she gives the police officer an alibi, and that's him way right, so I still think Cherie.

F2:	And we know it's not the cat woman, the…yeah.

	Here's an interesting one, which I think is meant to make us think.

	'Called her office, and they said she'd left on a business trip, not sure when she's supposed to get back.'

	So this gives the hint that she's run away from something, but she might actually just be running away 'cause she's scared. 

F1:	Yeah. Can I see Cherie again?

F3:	I think it's Chris guy killed. I think this is the most obvious, and the most straightforward thing. Chris killed Nick Webster, because he has an affair with Nick Webster's wife, and because Nick Webster's wife wants to sell the property.

F2:	But I can't see his motive.

F3:	Because he wants to fuck that pussy.

F4:	That's great in a transcript by the way.

F3:	[00:01:10]: I know, you're welcome.
