Part 39:

F2:	[2023/05/16 16:53:28 GMT+0000] So that's either… F1:	Neighbour who found a body? F2:	…CR could either be… F1:	She's the only neighbour, Joan's the only neighbour, right? F2:	So CR could be this pub, this, or, both of them have got CR, haven't they? F1:	Mmm. F3:	I would say the death was between 3:30 and 4:00 because collision between the cars, so maybe the cars were getting away, and I would say the death was somewhere here. So 3.30 is the CCTV right, so I would suspect… F1:	Okay. F2:	So CR could be County Road, or it could be… F1:	It says CR66, so County Road 66 makes sense. F2:	Yeah, yeah. F1	'To talk to neighbour who found body,' and Joan said she was the only neighbour, so Joan found the body. F3:	Who's John, oh Joan. F1:	The witch, Joan the witch. F3:	Joan found the body? Wait, what? F1:	So, 'I went to Country Road 66 to talk to neighbour who found body.' And she said… F3:	Yeah, so she was out for a walk right, yeah? F1:	Aha. 55.27 F3:	Oh wait, so [what the hell?] 

	[00:01:24]:, so she did all this weird shit. F2:	Yeah. F1:	So it says, 'her house is nearest the property to Old Scratch, not much else nearby.' So it must be her. F3:	Yeah, yeah, yeah. F1:	[00:01:35]: There you go, yeah, good call.
