F3:	[2023/05/16 16:43:51 GMT+0000] Or Mia's lying of course, but potentially.
F2:	I think it's true, because she, at 2.30 maybe the noise in the bar, the chap didn't leave the bar until 3.30, they went to the foxes, he'd gone by then because otherwise he would have come out. 
F1:	Well they were together chanting, right? 
 F3:	Yeah. 
F2:	For probably about an hour. 
F1:	And then by the time they were done, he was already gone because the fire had been put out… 
F2:	Yes. 
F3:	And Mia's last comment was at 4.47 so I imagine she came back home, when she wrote the comment. 
 F2:	Yeah, I think you're right. 
F3:	So they could have been together, that's… 
F2:	Yeah, it's a good call. 
F1:	I think so… 
F3:	But it's not a 100 per cent right. 
F1:	No, but they were together up until they left the fox and the fire was already put out, so yeah. 
F2:	Aha, good. 
F1:	Right, now we've got Chris Thompson. 
F3:	Did we have their names somewhere? 
F1:	No, but I think he's probably the deputy. F2:	I bet you he's the sheriff, the deputy sheriff, yeah, that would be my guess. 

F1:	Yeah, oh… 
F3:	Deputy. 
F2:	[00:00:44]: Oh yeah.
